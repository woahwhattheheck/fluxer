Almost every failed Media Proxy request answers with a short `text/plain` reason phrase and nothing else. The Media Proxy has no request-count rate limit, so every bound below is a resource bound.

## Media error response

An unsuccessful response body is an English reason phrase under the content type `text/plain; charset=utf-8`. The JSON [HTTP API error response](/http-api/#error-response) never appears here. `HEAD` returns the same status and headers with an empty body. The method rejection of a registered path<sup>2</sup> and a locally unsatisfiable range have neither a body nor a `Content-Type`.

| Status | Body | Condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | Bad request | An invalid storage key, dimension, format, or external path, an unparsable relay `partNumber`, a failed attachment or external transformation, or a relay upload body the endpoint failed to read from the client<sup>1</sup> |
| 401 | Unauthorized | An invalid signed external path signature, a missing, malformed, or expired relay capability, or a missing or invalid internal bearer token |
| 403 | Forbidden | A relay capability presented for another bucket, key, method, `uploadId`, or `partNumber`, `/_metrics` requested from a non-loopback address, or a public read whose `Origin` the [cross-origin read policy](/media-proxy/overview/#cross-origin-reads) refuses |
| 404 | Not found | A `GET` or `HEAD` of an unrouted path or of any read path on a `relay` endpoint, an object that does not exist, or a relay `PUT` outside `upload` and `relay` mode |
| 404 | This content is no longer available.<sup>4</sup> | An attachment read `enforce` refuses, or a missing attachment object under `enforce` |
| 405 | Method not allowed<sup>2</sup> | A method other than `GET` or `HEAD` on a read route or on an unrouted path |
| 413 | Payload too large | A stored object, external body, upload body, or internal request body beyond its bound |
| 500 | Transcode failed | An image asset transcode failed and the source is not directly displayable |
| 500 | Internal server error | A relay spool write to the endpoint's own disk failed |
| 502 | Bad gateway | An object store read or write failed, an external origin fetch failed, an external origin redirected in a loop or more than five times, or an external origin returned an unsuccessful status that the Media Proxy does not pass through, or an outbound socket deadline or a relay object storage write deadline expired |
| 503 | Service unavailable | The upload relay spool budget is exhausted, an external buffer reservation or allocation failed, or an external origin answered `/_metadata` with 429<sup>3</sup> |
| 504 | Gateway timeout | A transformation admission slot was unavailable or the transformation deadline expired |

<sup>1</sup> The relay also answers 400 when the client connection fails part way through the body

<sup>2</sup> The registered paths, `/_health`, `/_metrics`, `/_metadata`, `/_sniff`, `/_thumbnail`, `/_frames`, and `/v1/relay/{key}`, answer an unaccepted method with an empty body, no `Content-Type`, and an `Allow` header. All seven are registered in every mode, so the method rejection is the same in every mode, even where the path itself answers 404

<sup>3</sup> `/_metadata` is the only endpoint that remaps an origin 429. The signed external read route retains 429 as 429

<sup>4</sup> Sent under the `enforce` [signed attachment URL policy](/media-proxy/overview/#signed-attachment-urls) alone, where it also replaces `Not found` for an attachment object that does not exist. Under `report` every response is the one `off` returns, so a missing object keeps the `Not found` body there

When the Media Proxy passes an external origin status through to the client, the body is `Upstream fetch failed` on the signed external read route. On `/_metadata`, the body is the canonical reason phrase of that status. An object store error that maps to no case above uses the canonical reason phrase of its status.

Every error a route produces uses `Cache-Control: no-store` and the standard [security headers](/media-proxy/overview/#representation-headers). The exceptions have the security headers and set no cache policy, and [Cache policies](#cache-policies) names them. No plain-text error has CORS headers unless it came from the [upload relay](/media-proxy/upload-relay/), and no error has `Retry-After` or a request identifier. Under the `enforce` [cross-origin read policy](/media-proxy/overview/#cross-origin-reads), every `GET` or `HEAD` error on a read path has `Vary: Accept-Encoding, Origin`. That includes the 403 for a refused `Origin`.

### Handling contract

The set of reason phrases is open. A client MUST branch on the HTTP status and MUST NOT parse, compare, or pattern-match the body. A phrase can be reworded and a new condition can introduce one without a version change. A client MUST NOT expect a JSON body on a failure, and MUST NOT expect a failure to name the key, parameter, or field that caused it.

## Status registry

Every `HEAD` response has an empty body, so the Body column describes `GET`, `PUT`, and `POST`.

| Status | Body | Condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 200<sup>1</sup> | Media bytes, or an empty `HEAD` or relay `PUT` body | A complete representation was served or a relay write succeeded |
| 206 | Selected media bytes for `GET` and empty for `HEAD` | One byte range is satisfiable |
| 400 | [Media error response](#media-error-response) | A path, query, target, transformation, or relay request is invalid |
| 401 | [Media error response](#media-error-response) | An external path signature, a relay capability, or an internal token is invalid |
| 403 | [Media error response](#media-error-response) | The cross-origin read policy denied the request, a relay capability does not match the request, or an external origin returned 403 |
| 404 | [Media error response](#media-error-response) | The route or object does not exist, a `relay` endpoint received a read, the relay is not served here, an attachment signature was refused, or an external origin returned 404 |
| 405<sup>2</sup> | [Media error response](#media-error-response) | The route rejects the method, or an external origin returned 405 |
| 406, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 414, 415, 428, 429<sup>3</sup> | [Media error response](#media-error-response) | An external origin returned that status |
| 413 | [Media error response](#media-error-response) | A source, external response, or upload exceeds its applicable bound |
| 416<sup>4</sup> | empty locally, otherwise [Media error response](#media-error-response) | A local range is unsatisfiable, or an external origin returned 416 |
| 500 | [Media error response](#media-error-response) | An image asset transcode failed with no usable source, or a relay spool write failed |
| 502 | [Media error response](#media-error-response) | An object store, external origin, or upload destination returned an unusable response |
| 503 | [Media error response](#media-error-response) | Upload spool capacity is exhausted, an external buffer reservation or allocation failed, or an external origin answered `/_metadata` with 429<sup>5</sup> |
| 504 | [Media error response](#media-error-response) | Transformation capacity was unavailable or a transformation deadline expired |

<sup>1</sup> The [internal endpoints](/media-proxy/routes/#operator-and-internal-endpoints) `/_metadata`, `/_sniff`, and `/_frames` answer 200 with JSON, `/_health` with plain text, and `/_metrics` with the Prometheus text exposition

<sup>2</sup> A read route path, or any other path outside the registered paths, answers with the [media error response](#media-error-response). Each registered path answers with an empty body, no `Content-Type`, and an `Allow` header

<sup>3</sup> These statuses occur only when an external origin returned that status and the Media Proxy passed it through

<sup>4</sup> A locally unsatisfiable range answers with an empty body, `Content-Range: bytes */{size}`, and `Accept-Ranges: bytes`, and has no `Content-Type` and no cache policy

<sup>5</sup> The remap produces a service unavailable response, which is indistinguishable from a budget exhaustion 503

An external origin status of 400, 401, 403, 404, 405, 406, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416, 428, or 429 reaches the client unchanged as an upstream fetch failure. The origin response body and headers are not forwarded. Any other unsuccessful origin status becomes 502.

The Media Proxy evaluates no conditional request header and never redirects a noncanonical target, so it returns no 304 and no 308.

## Request and media limits

Proxied or stored media is limited to 500 MiB, and exceeding that returns 413. The bound applies to a streamed object, a buffered object, an external response body, and any input selected for transformation. When a streamed external body passes the bound only after the response head is committed, the Media Proxy truncates it.

A decoded signed external target URL is limited to 8,192 bytes, and a longer URL returns 400. The route follows at most five redirects. A sixth redirect or a redirect loop returns 502. Every redirect target is subject to the same URL limit and the same public address check, which blocks non-public IP addresses and every port other than 80 and 443.

Decoded images are limited to 16,384 pixels on either edge and 268,435,456 pixels in total. Animated input is limited to 20,000 frames and 1,073,741,824 decoded pixels across all frames. No configuration changes these bounds. [Transformations](/media-proxy/transformations/#transformation-limits) defines the resulting failure statuses.

The upload relay limits a body to the smaller of the authorised upload size and the endpoint body limit. That endpoint limit defaults to 500 MiB and can be configured from 1 byte through 5 GiB.

An internal `/_metadata`, `/_sniff`, `/_thumbnail`, or `/_frames` request body is limited to the base64 expansion of the 500 MiB media bound plus 1 MiB. All answer a larger body with 413.

## Work admission

A transformation returns 504 when capacity is unavailable or its deadline expires. Upload and external-media requests can return 503 when their capacity is exhausted.

## Deadlines

| Deadline | Default | Configurable range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Outbound socket connect and total timeout<sup>1</sup> | 30,000 ms | 0 through 300,000 ms |
| Transformation | 15,000 ms | 1,000 through 120,000 ms |
| Upload relay object storage write<sup>2</sup> | 900,000 ms | 1,000 through 3,600,000 ms |

<sup>1</sup> One value sets both the connect timeout and the total request timeout, and it applies to external origin fetches, to object storage requests, and to the response body streamed back to the client

<sup>2</sup> A relay write with a declared `Content-Length` extends this deadline by one second for every 16 KiB of declared length

The same socket timeout bounds every streamed response body. A streamed stored object and a streamed signed external response terminate when the gap between two body chunks exceeds that timeout. The whole transfer has a second deadline of that timeout plus one second for every 16 KiB of expected length, which is a floor of 16 KiB per second. A body that ends before, or runs past, the advertised `Content-Length` also terminates with an error.

An animated response can be shortened to meet its deadline or playback limit. See [Transformation limits](/media-proxy/transformations/#transformation-limits).

:::caution[A deadline after the head truncates the body]
A status and its headers are chosen before the body is sent. A streamed object store or external response that fails afterwards terminates the body, so the observed body can be shorter than the advertised `Content-Length`.
:::

## Cache policies

Every successful media representation uses `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000` and `CDN-Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000`. An audio or video representation appends `no-transform` to `Cache-Control` only. Signed external media uses the same policy as stored media.

No route sets `immutable`, `Expires`, `ETag`, or `Last-Modified` on a read response. A cache revalidates a representation by fetching it again.

One read selects a shorter policy. Under the `report` or `enforce` [signed attachment URL policy](/media-proxy/overview/#signed-attachment-urls), an attachment read whose signature is valid gets `public, max-age=` the seconds left on that signature in both headers, so no entry outlives the URL that made it. A data package URL never expires, so it gets the one-day ceiling instead. Every other read, and every attachment read under `off`, keeps the year.

A one-year `max-age` is only safe where a purge path reaches every cache that stores media. With no `ETag` and no `Last-Modified` there is nothing to revalidate against, so a deleted or replaced object is served until its entry is purged or drops out. A cache with no purge path must set a shorter lifetime of its own instead. [Caching in front of Fluxer](/operator/reverse-proxy/#caching-in-front-of-fluxer) states how.

Every route-produced error response uses `Cache-Control: no-store`, and a successful `/_metrics` read uses it too. A 416 response, a successful upload relay response, and the empty-body method rejection of a registered path set no cache policy at all.

## Range response headers

A complete media response has `Accept-Ranges: bytes`, the representation `Content-Type`, and an exact `Content-Length`<sup>1</sup>. Outside `static` mode that `Content-Type` is `text/plain; charset=utf-8` when it names a JavaScript media type, and a 200 or 206 with no `Content-Type` gets the same value. [Content detection](/media-proxy/overview/#content-detection) defines both rules. A 206 also sets `Content-Range` to the selected interval over the complete size and `Content-Length` to the selected byte count. A 416 has `Content-Range: bytes */{size}` and `Accept-Ranges: bytes` with an empty body.

<sup>1</sup> A streamed signed external response omits `Content-Length` when the origin declared none

`HEAD` applies the same range contract as `GET` and returns 206 or 416 with an empty body. A forwarded external range is answered with the origin `Content-Range` and `Content-Length` unchanged. [Byte ranges](/media-proxy/overview/#byte-ranges) defines which request ranges are recognised.
