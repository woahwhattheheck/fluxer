title: Gateway events
description: Every main Gateway Dispatch event, its payload, its delivery scope, and its replay behaviour.
---

A Dispatch reports a change or command result through the [Gateway](/gateway/overview/). It has [opcode](/gateway/opcodes-and-close-codes/#opcodes) 0, an event name, and a payload.

## Dispatch envelope

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| op | integer | Value 0 |
| t | string | Uppercase event name |
| s | integer | Non-negative session sequence |
| d | any | Payload defined for the named event |

```json
{
  "op": 0,
  "t": "MESSAGE_CREATE",
  "s": 17,
  "d": { }
}
```

[Ready](#ready) establishes sequence 1. Live Dispatches advance it by one. Replayed Dispatches keep their original sequence and can have gaps. [Resumed](#resumed) has the session's current sequence without advancing it. The next live Dispatch has that sequence plus one. The sequence is local to one Gateway session and orders nothing across shards or HTTP operations.

## Dispatch delivery

[Event filtering](/gateway/event-filtering/) defines delivery by guild availability, channel visibility, permissions, and session settings. Account-scoped Dispatches go through only the session-level filters, which are the shard filter and the `ignored_events` list.

Most guild-scoped Dispatches have a `guild_id` string. [Guild Create](#guild-create) and [Guild Sync](#guild-sync) identify the guild as `id`, and so does every [Guild Delete](#guild-delete) other than the one the guild itself dispatches when the guild is deleted. [Guild Counts Update](#guild-counts-update) and [Channel Member Counts Update](#channel-member-counts-update) have no top-level `guild_id`, and each entry in their `counts` array has its own.

The originating session is excluded from a Dispatch only for [Message Reaction Add](#message-reaction-add) and [Message Reaction Remove](#message-reaction-remove) in a guild channel, and only when the request supplied a `session_id`. That field is removed from the payload. The same field on a direct message or group direct message reaction is forwarded to every recipient unchanged and excludes nobody. The actor that issues any other mutation receives the resulting Dispatch like every other eligible session.

A Dispatch is buffered for [Resume](/gateway/commands/#resume) replay unless it is [Guild Sync](#guild-sync), [Guild Member List Update](#guild-member-list-update), or [Guild Members Chunk](#guild-members-chunk). Those are delivered live and never retained. A single oversized Dispatch is delivered but not retained, as [Limits and rate limits](/gateway/limits-and-rate-limits/#replay-and-backpressure) describes. [Ready](#ready) and the guild burst that follows it for a bot session are also sent outside the replay buffer. The initial [Call Create](#call-create) events are retained like any other Dispatch and are replayed on Resume.

## Session and current user

### <span id="ready-object"></span>READY

The initial session state. Sent once after a successful [Identify](/gateway/commands/#identify), always with sequence 1.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| session_id | string | Identifier for [Resume](/gateway/commands/#resume) |
| version | integer | Gateway API version the connection negotiated, always `1` |
| user | [user](/http-api/users/#user-object) object | The authenticated account in its private representation |
| guilds<sup>1</sup> | array[[guild ready object](#guild-ready-object)] | The session's guilds |
| private_channels | array[[channel](/http-api/channels/#channel-object) object] | Direct message and group direct message channels |
| relationships<sup>2</sup> | array[[relationship](/http-api/users/relationships/#relationship-object) object] | The account's relationships |
| presences<sup>3</sup> | array[[presence object](#presence-object)] | Visible presences at connection time |
| users<sup>4</sup> | array[[partial user](/http-api/users/#partial-user-object) object] | Users referenced by the payload |
| sessions | array[[session presence object](#session-presence-object)] | The account's other live sessions |
| read_states | array[[read state](/http-api/read-states/#read-state-object) object] | Per-channel read state |
| user_settings | ?[user settings](/http-api/users/#user-settings-object) object | Account-wide settings |
| user_guild_settings | array[[user guild settings](/http-api/users/settings/#user-guild-settings-object) object] | Per-guild notification settings |
| notes | map[snowflake, string] | Private notes keyed by user ID |
| pinned_dms | array[snowflake] | Pinned private channel IDs |
| favorite_memes | array[[meme](/http-api/memes/#meme-object) object] | Saved memes |
| webauthn_credentials | array[[WebAuthn credential object](#webauthn-credential-object)] | Registered WebAuthn credentials |
| rtc_regions | array[[RTC region object](#rtc-region-object)] | Voice regions, ordered nearest first |
| country_code | string | Country resolved from the connecting address, `US` when the address resolves to none |
| latitude? | string | Latitude resolved from the connecting address, rendered as a decimal string |
| longitude? | string | Longitude resolved from the connecting address, rendered as a decimal string |
| auth_session_id_hash? | string | Base64url hash identifying the authentication session |
| shard? | array[integer] | The accepted `[shard_id, shard_count]` pair, present only when Identify supplied one |
| _timings? | object | HTTP-side timing breakdown, present only for a staff account |
| _timings_gw? | object | Gateway-side timing breakdown, present only for a staff account |

<sup>1</sup> On a bot session every entry is an unavailable guild with `id` and `unavailable: true` alone. The burst described below then sends a [Guild Create](#guild-create) with the full state of each available guild, and a [Guild Delete](#guild-delete) for each unavailable one

<sup>2</sup> Each entry has its `user` field removed and the removed accounts appear in `users` instead, so a client resolves a relationship through the entry's `id`

<sup>3</sup> A bot session always receives an empty array here

<sup>4</sup> Collected from the account's relationships, the recipients of its private channels, and the members in `guilds`, deduplicated by account ID. A bot session always receives an empty array here

Ready is sent outside the replay buffer, so a [Resume](/gateway/commands/#resume) never replays it.

A bot session receives one [Guild Create](#guild-create) per available guild immediately after Ready, and one [Guild Delete](#guild-delete) per unavailable guild. Together they resolve the entries of the `guilds` array. Those Dispatches are also sent outside the replay buffer.

Shortly after Ready, every session receives one [Call Create](#call-create) for each of its private channels that has an active call.

#### Guild ready object

The same structure appears in Ready, [Guild Create](#guild-create), and [Guild Sync](#guild-sync).

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | snowflake | Guild ID |
| properties | [guild](/http-api/guilds/#guild-object) object | Guild record without its roles, channels, emojis, stickers, or members |
| roles | array[[guild role](/http-api/permissions/#guild-role-object) object] | Every role in the guild |
| channels | array[[channel](/http-api/channels/#channel-object) object] | Channels the session can view |
| emojis | array[[guild emoji](/http-api/guild-emojis/#guild-emoji-object) object] | Every emoji in the guild |
| stickers | array[[guild sticker](/http-api/guild-stickers/#guild-sticker-object) object] | Every sticker in the guild |
| members<sup>1</sup> | array[[guild member](/http-api/guild-members/#guild-member-object) object] | The members the session needs immediately |
| member_count | integer | Total member count |
| online_count<sup>2</sup> | integer | Online member count |
| presences<sup>3</sup> | array[[presence object](#presence-object)] | Always an empty array |
| voice_states | array[[voice state object](#voice-state-object)] | Voice states in channels the session can view |
| joined_at | ?ISO8601 timestamp | When the account joined the guild, null when the account is not a member |
| unavailable? | boolean | Whether the guild is unavailable |
| unavailable_hidden? | boolean | Whether an unavailable guild is hidden from the client |

<sup>1</sup> The session's own member object plus the member object of every participant named by `voice_states`, and nothing else. A client that needs the rest of the roster asks for it with [Request Guild Members](/gateway/commands/#request-guild-members) or subscribes to a member list through [Lazy Request](/gateway/commands/#lazy-request)

<sup>2</sup> Counts the members that hold a live Gateway session and publish a status other than `offline` or `invisible`. Every recipient receives the same guild-wide figure. [Guild Counts Update](#guild-counts-update) reports a per-viewer count

<sup>3</sup> Guild presences arrive as separate [Presence Update](#presence-update) and [Presence Update Bulk](#presence-update-bulk) Dispatches

An unavailable guild is reduced to `id` and `unavailable: true`, plus `unavailable_hidden: true` when the guild is hidden. It has none of the other fields. Every entry in a bot session's [Ready](#ready) `guilds` array has this form, with `id` and `unavailable: true` alone.

Inside [Ready](#ready), and inside the [Guild Create](#guild-create) burst a bot receives immediately after Ready, each entry in `members` has its `user` replaced by `{"id": "..."}`. A bot session's Ready has no `members` at all, because each of its guilds is an unavailable guild, so a bot sees the reduced form in the burst alone. On a user session the removed accounts appear in the Ready payload's `users` array. A bot's `users` array is empty, so a bot pulls those accounts with [Request Guild Members](/gateway/commands/#request-guild-members). A [Guild Create](#guild-create) sent later in the session, and every [Guild Sync](#guild-sync), have the members with `user` intact.

#### Session presence object

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| session_id | string | Session identifier, or the literal `all` for the aggregate entry |
| status | string | `online`, `idle`, `dnd`, `invisible`, or `offline` |
| afk | boolean | Whether the session is away |
| mobile | boolean | Whether the session is mobile |

The first entry always has `session_id: "all"` and the account's combined status, which is the first of `dnd`, `online`, `idle`, and `invisible` that any of its sessions has, or `offline` when none has one.

#### WebAuthn credential object

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | string | Credential ID |
| name | string | Credential name |
| created_at | ISO8601 timestamp | When the credential was registered |
| last_used_at | ?ISO8601 timestamp | When the credential was last used |

#### RTC region object

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | string | Region ID |
| name | string | Human-readable region name |
| emoji | string | Region emoji |

The array always begins with a synthetic entry whose `id` is `automatic`, `name` is `Automatic`, and `emoji` is the globe. Choosing that entry leaves the region to the server. Every other entry is a region the account can select, ordered by distance from the `latitude` and `longitude` in the [Identify properties](/gateway/commands/#identify-properties-object). Fluxer orders by distance only when both values parse as finite numbers, and otherwise orders by region ID.

### RESUMED

Sent after a successful [Resume](/gateway/commands/#resume) has replayed every retained Dispatch above the supplied sequence.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _timings_gw? | object | Gateway-side timing breakdown, present only for a staff account |

The payload is otherwise empty. Resumed has the session's current sequence in `s` without advancing it, and the next live Dispatch has that sequence plus one.

### <span id="sessions-replace"></span>SESSIONS_REPLACE

The account's set of live sessions changed. The payload is a bare JSON array of [session presence objects](#session-presence-object) and is always the complete set. A client that stores the sessions replaces them with this array. [Ready](#ready) sends the initial set as `sessions`.

### <span id="auth-session-change"></span>AUTH_SESSION_CHANGE

The account's authentication session was rotated, for example by a password change on another device.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| old_auth_session_id_hash | string | Base64url hash of the authentication session that was replaced |
| new_auth_session_id_hash | string | Base64url hash of the replacement authentication session |
| new_token | string | Replacement for the token the client holds |

Every session of the account receives the event, including the one that caused the rotation. A client MUST use `new_token` for every later HTTP request and for any later [Resume](/gateway/commands/#resume) or [Identify](/gateway/commands/#identify). A client whose own `auth_session_id_hash` from [Ready](#ready) equals `old_auth_session_id_hash` MUST replace it with `new_auth_session_id_hash`.

### <span id="rate-limited"></span>RATE_LIMITED

A [Request Guild Members](/gateway/commands/#request-guild-members) command was refused by the bot full-member-list budget. Delivered to the requesting session alone.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| opcode | integer | The refused opcode, which is always `8` |
| retry_after | number | Seconds until the request can be retried |
| meta | object | Context for the refused request |

`meta` has `guild_id` and, when the request named exactly one guild and supplied a valid nonce, `nonce`.

That budget admits one unfiltered member request per bot account and guild every 30,000 ms, and `retry_after` is the remainder of that window in seconds. Every other command refusal is silent.

### <span id="user-update"></span>USER_UPDATE

The current user's account record changed. The payload is the complete [user object](/http-api/users/#user-object) in its private representation.

Presence subscribers receive the updated `user` in a [Presence Update](#presence-update), unless the user's published status is `offline`.

### <span id="user-settings-update"></span>USER_SETTINGS_UPDATE

The current user's account-wide settings changed. The payload is the complete [user settings object](/http-api/users/#user-settings-object).

Fluxer republishes the account's presence on every settings update, whether or not `status` or `custom_status` changed. A `status` of `offline` in the payload is treated as `invisible`, and it forces every live session of the account to that status.

### <span id="user-guild-settings-update"></span>USER_GUILD_SETTINGS_UPDATE

One guild's notification settings changed. The payload is that guild's complete user guild settings object.

### <span id="user-note-update"></span>USER_NOTE_UPDATE

The current user wrote or cleared a private note.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | snowflake | User the note is about |
| note | string | Note text, empty when cleared |

### <span id="user-pinned-dms-update"></span>USER_PINNED_DMS_UPDATE

The current user's pinned private channel set changed. The payload is a bare JSON array of channel ID strings in pinned order and is always the complete set. A client that stores the pinned channels replaces them with this array. [Ready](#ready) sends the initial set as `pinned_dms`.

### <span id="user-connections-update"></span>USER_CONNECTIONS_UPDATE

The current user's external connection set changed.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| connections | array[connection object] | Every connection the account holds |

`connections` is always the complete set. A client that stores the connections replaces them with this array.

### <span id="webauthn-credentials-update"></span>WEBAUTHN_CREDENTIALS_UPDATE

The current user's WebAuthn credential set changed. The payload is a bare JSON array of [WebAuthn credential objects](#webauthn-credential-object) and is always the complete set. A client that stores the credentials replaces them with this array. [Ready](#ready) sends the initial set as `webauthn_credentials`.

### <span id="relationship-add"></span>RELATIONSHIP_ADD

The current user gained a relationship. The payload is the complete relationship object.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | snowflake | The other user's ID |
| type | integer | [Relationship type](/http-api/users/relationships/#relationship-types) |
| user | [partial user](/http-api/users/#partial-user-object) object | The other user |
| since? | ISO8601 timestamp | When the relationship was created, absent when the record has no timestamp |
| nickname | ?string | Private nickname for the other user |
| share_voice_activity | boolean | Whether the current user shares voice activity with this friend on the Active Now panel |
| friend_shares_voice_activity<sup>1</sup> | boolean | Whether the other user shares voice activity with the current user |

<sup>1</sup> Always `true` on this Dispatch, even for a friendship whose counterpart has sharing off

A client that needs the real value MUST read it from [List relationships](/http-api/users/relationships/#list-relationships).

### <span id="relationship-update"></span>RELATIONSHIP_UPDATE

An existing relationship changed. The payload has the same structure as [Relationship Add](#relationship-add).

`friend_shares_voice_activity` is the counterpart's real setting only on the pair of Dispatches that [Modify voice activity sharing](/http-api/users/settings/#modify-voice-activity-sharing) sends to both parties of each friendship. Every other Relationship Update sends `true`.

### <span id="relationship-remove"></span>RELATIONSHIP_REMOVE

A relationship ended.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | snowflake | The other user's ID |

### <span id="saved-message-create"></span>SAVED_MESSAGE_CREATE

The current user saved a message. The payload is the complete [message object](/http-api/messages/#message-object) as that user sees it.

### <span id="saved-message-delete"></span>SAVED_MESSAGE_DELETE

The current user unsaved a message.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| message_id | snowflake | The message that is no longer saved |

### <span id="recent-mention-delete"></span>RECENT_MENTION_DELETE

The current user removed a message from the recent mention feed.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| message_id | snowflake | The message removed from the feed |

### <span id="favorite-meme-create"></span>FAVORITE_MEME_CREATE

The current user saved a meme. The payload is the complete [meme object](/http-api/memes/#meme-object).

### <span id="favorite-meme-update"></span>FAVORITE_MEME_UPDATE

One of the current user's memes changed. The payload is the complete [meme object](/http-api/memes/#meme-object).

### <span id="favorite-meme-delete"></span>FAVORITE_MEME_DELETE

The current user deleted a meme.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| meme_id | snowflake | The deleted meme |

## Guilds and channels

### <span id="guild-create"></span>GUILD_CREATE

A guild became available to the session. The payload is a [guild ready object](#guild-ready-object).

`roles`, `channels`, `emojis`, `stickers`, and `voice_states` are always complete. A client that stores any of them for the guild replaces its stored list with the new array. `members` is a partial list. A client adds or updates those members and keeps every other member it already stores.

Every session receives Guild Create when a guild becomes available after Ready, for example after joining one or after an unavailable guild recovers. A bot session also receives one for each available guild in the burst that follows Ready.

A bot session's Guild Create has `unavailable: false` unless it is the first Guild Create for a guild the bot joined during the session and [Ready](#ready) did not list. That Dispatch has no `unavailable` field, even when a [Guild Delete](#guild-delete) with `unavailable: true` for the guild came before it. A user session never receives the field on Guild Create.

### <span id="guild-sync"></span>GUILD_SYNC

A session that asked for a sync through [Lazy Request](/gateway/commands/#lazy-request) receives the guild's full current state again. The payload is a [guild ready object](#guild-ready-object), and a client handles it the same way as [Guild Create](#guild-create).

Fluxer sends a sync when a Lazy Request switches the guild between [active and passive](/gateway/event-filtering/#active-and-passive-guilds), and when `sync: true` names a guild the session has not already synced. A second `sync: true` for an already-synced guild sends nothing.

### <span id="guild-update"></span>GUILD_UPDATE

A guild's configuration changed. The payload is the complete [guild object](/http-api/guilds/#guild-object) with `guild_id` added, which repeats the object's own `id`.

Guild Update is the only Dispatch an unavailable guild sends. A client learns from it that a guild entered or left the unavailable state.

### <span id="guild-delete"></span>GUILD_DELETE

A guild left the session's visibility, or became unavailable.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | snowflake | Guild ID |
| guild_id?<sup>1</sup> | snowflake | Repeats `id` |
| unavailable? | boolean | True when the guild is temporarily unavailable |
| unavailable_hidden? | boolean | True when an unavailable guild is hidden from the client |

<sup>1</sup> Present only when the guild itself is deleted. The payload has `id` alone when the account leaves a guild or is removed from one, and `id` with `unavailable` in the unavailable form

Without `unavailable`, the account is no longer a member, and a client deletes everything it stores for that guild. With `unavailable: true`, the guild is temporarily unreachable. A client keeps the guild as an unavailable entry until a later [Guild Create](#guild-create) sends its full state again.

### <span id="guild-role-create"></span>GUILD_ROLE_CREATE

A role was created in a guild.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| guild_id | snowflake | Guild the role belongs to |
| role | [guild role](/http-api/permissions/#guild-role-object) object | The created role |

### <span id="guild-role-update"></span>GUILD_ROLE_UPDATE

Exactly one role record changed.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| guild_id | snowflake | Guild the role belongs to |
| role | [guild role](/http-api/permissions/#guild-role-object) object | The role's complete updated representation |

### <span id="guild-role-update-bulk"></span>GUILD_ROLE_UPDATE_BULK

One operation changed several roles together, most often a reorder.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| guild_id | snowflake | Guild the roles belong to |
| roles | array[[guild role](/http-api/permissions/#guild-role-object) object] | Every changed role in its complete updated representation |

### <span id="guild-role-delete"></span>GUILD_ROLE_DELETE

A role was deleted from a guild.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| guild_id | snowflake | Guild the role belonged to |
| role_id | snowflake | The deleted role |

### <span id="guild-emojis-update"></span>GUILD_EMOJIS_UPDATE

A guild's emojis changed.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| guild_id | snowflake | Guild the emojis belong to |
| emojis | array[[guild emoji](/http-api/guild-emojis/#guild-emoji-object) object] | Every emoji in the guild |

A client that stores the guild's emojis replaces them with this array. Fluxer does not send per-emoji create, update, or delete events.

### <span id="guild-stickers-update"></span>GUILD_STICKERS_UPDATE

A guild's stickers changed.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| guild_id | snowflake | Guild the stickers belong to |
| stickers | array[[guild sticker](/http-api/guild-stickers/#guild-sticker-object) object] | Every sticker in the guild |

A client that stores the guild's stickers replaces them with this array. Fluxer does not send per-sticker create, update, or delete events.

### <span id="channel-create"></span>CHANNEL_CREATE

A channel became visible to the session, whether newly created or newly permitted. The payload is the complete [channel object](/http-api/channels/#channel-object), with `guild_id` present for a guild channel.

### <span id="channel-update"></span>CHANNEL_UPDATE

A visible channel changed. The payload is the complete [channel object](/http-api/channels/#channel-object).

### <span id="channel-update-bulk"></span>CHANNEL_UPDATE_BULK

One operation changed several channels together, most often a reorder.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| guild_id | snowflake | Guild the channels belong to |
| channels | array[[channel](/http-api/channels/#channel-object) object] | Every changed channel in its complete updated representation |

Each recipient sees only channels they can view. An empty result produces no Dispatch and consumes no sequence number.

### <span id="channel-delete"></span>CHANNEL_DELETE

A channel left the session's visibility, whether deleted or newly hidden. The payload is the complete [channel object](/http-api/channels/#channel-object) as it was before the change.

Recipients are the sessions that could see the channel before it was deleted.

### <span id="channel-recipient-add"></span>CHANNEL_RECIPIENT_ADD

A user joined a group direct message the session belongs to.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| channel_id | snowflake | Group direct message channel |
| user | [partial user](/http-api/users/#partial-user-object) object | The user that joined |

### <span id="channel-recipient-remove"></span>CHANNEL_RECIPIENT_REMOVE

A user left a group direct message the session belongs to.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| channel_id | snowflake | Group direct message channel |
| user | [partial user](/http-api/users/#partial-user-object) object | The user that left |

### <span id="webhooks-update"></span>WEBHOOKS_UPDATE

The webhook set of a guild channel changed. The event has no webhook data, so a client that needs the new set reads it over the HTTP API.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| guild_id | snowflake | Guild the channel belongs to |
| channel_id | snowflake | Channel whose webhooks changed |

### <span id="invite-create"></span>INVITE_CREATE

An invite was created. The payload is the complete [invite object](/http-api/invites/#invite-object) extended with its [invite metadata](/http-api/invites/#invite-metadata-object).

A guild invite reaches the sessions holding `MANAGE_CHANNELS` on the invite's channel. A group direct message invite reaches every recipient of that group, with no permission check.

### <span id="invite-delete"></span>INVITE_DELETE

An invite was deleted.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| code | string | The deleted invite code |
| channel_id? | snowflake | Channel the invite pointed at, absent when the invite stored none |
| guild_id?<sup>1</sup> | snowflake | Guild the invite belonged to |

<sup>1</sup> Present on every guild invite. A group direct message invite has no `guild_id`

Recipients are chosen the same way as for [Invite Create](#invite-create).

## Members and moderation

### <span id="guild-member-add"></span>GUILD_MEMBER_ADD

A user became a member of a guild the session is connected to. The payload is the complete [guild member object](/http-api/guild-members/#guild-member-object) with `guild_id` added.

### <span id="guild-member-update"></span>GUILD_MEMBER_UPDATE

A member's guild state or public user representation changed. The payload is the complete [guild member object](/http-api/guild-members/#guild-member-object) with `guild_id` added.

In a guild with more than 250 members, a [passive](/gateway/event-filtering/#active-and-passive-guilds) session receives this event only when the subject is its own user.

### <span id="guild-member-remove"></span>GUILD_MEMBER_REMOVE

A user stopped being a member of a guild the session is connected to.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| guild_id | snowflake | Guild the user left |
| user<sup>1</sup> | object | The user that is no longer a member |

<sup>1</sup> The object has `id` alone. No other account field is sent, so a client MUST resolve the account from state it already holds

In a guild with more than 250 members, a [passive](/gateway/event-filtering/#active-and-passive-guilds) session receives this event only when the subject is its own user.

### <span id="guild-members-chunk"></span>GUILD_MEMBERS_CHUNK

Answers [Request Guild Members](/gateway/commands/#request-guild-members) for the requesting session.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| guild_id | snowflake | Guild the members belong to |
| members | array[[guild member](/http-api/guild-members/#guild-member-object) object] | Up to 1,000 members |
| chunk_index | integer | Zero-based index of this chunk |
| chunk_count | integer | Total chunks in this response |
| presences? | array[[presence object](#presence-object)] | Present only when the request set `presences` and at least one member has a visible presence |
| nonce? | string | Echoed only when the request named exactly one guild and supplied a valid nonce |

A request that matches no member still produces one chunk with an empty `members` array, `chunk_index` 0, and `chunk_count` 1.

This event is delivered live and is never retained for [Resume](/gateway/commands/#resume) replay.

### <span id="guild-member-list-update"></span>GUILD_MEMBER_LIST_UPDATE

A member list the session subscribed to through [Lazy Request](/gateway/commands/#lazy-request) resyncs the subscriber's ranges.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| guild_id | snowflake | Guild the list belongs to |
| id | string | List identifier, which is always the channel ID as a string |
| channel_id? | snowflake | Channel the list is scoped to |
| member_count | integer | Total members in the list |
| online_count | integer | Online members in the list |
| groups | array[[member list group object](#member-list-group-object)] | Group headers in list order |
| ops | array[[member list operation object](#member-list-operation-object)] | Operations to apply |

#### Member list group object

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id<sup>1</sup> | string | Group identifier, which is a hoisted role ID, `online`, or `offline` |
| count | integer | Members in the group |

<sup>1</sup> Hoisted role groups come first in role order, then `online`, then `offline`

A group whose count is `0` is omitted. The `offline` group is also omitted once it holds more than 1,000 members, and in that case `items` omits the offline members too. `member_count` can then exceed the number of items a client can ever read back.

#### Member list operation object

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| op | string | Operation kind, which is always `SYNC` |
| range | array[integer] | Inclusive `[start, end]` range this operation replaces |
| items | array[[member list item object](#member-list-item-object)] | Replacement items for the range |

`SYNC` is the only operation Fluxer sends. A client MUST ignore an operation whose `op` it does not recognise or whose range fails the bounds in [Lazy Request](/gateway/commands/#lazy-request).

#### Member list item object

Each item has exactly one of the fields.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| group? | [member list group object](#member-list-group-object) | A group header occupying one list position |
| member?<sup>1</sup> | [guild member](/http-api/guild-members/#guild-member-object) object | A member of the list |

<sup>1</sup> Extended with a `presence` field that always exists. The value is the guild's [presence object](#presence-object) for that member when the member is visibly online to the guild, and otherwise the placeholder `{"status": "offline", "mobile": false, "afk": false}`

### <span id="guild-audit-log-entry-create"></span>GUILD_AUDIT_LOG_ENTRY_CREATE

An audit log entry was written. The payload is the [guild audit log entry object](/http-api/guild-audit-logs/#guild-audit-log-entry-object) that [List guild audit logs](/http-api/guild-audit-logs/#list-guild-audit-logs) returns for the same entry, with `guild_id` added. It always has `id`, `action_type`, `user_id`, and `target_id`. `reason` is resolved as the [audit log reason](/http-api/guild-audit-logs/#audit-log-reason) describes, and `options` has only the published [audit log options](/http-api/guild-audit-logs/#audit-log-options-object) keys, with the same number and boolean types. `changes` is present when at least one change survives scrubbing.

An update that changes nothing records no entry, as the [audit actions](/http-api/guild-audit-logs/#audit-actions) registry states, so it emits no event.

The `ip` change key is stripped from `changes`, so an entry whose only change was `ip` has no `changes` at all. A client MUST treat an absent `options` or `changes` as an empty set.

Recipients are every session in the guild that holds `VIEW_AUDIT_LOG`, including the acting session.

### <span id="guild-ban-add"></span>GUILD_BAN_ADD

A guild ban was created.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| guild_id | snowflake | Guild the ban was created in |
| user<sup>1</sup> | object | The banned user |

<sup>1</sup> The object has `id` alone. No other account field is sent

### <span id="guild-ban-remove"></span>GUILD_BAN_REMOVE

A guild ban was removed.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| guild_id | snowflake | Guild the ban was removed from |
| user<sup>1</sup> | object | The unbanned user |

<sup>1</sup> The object has `id` alone. No other account field is sent

### <span id="presence-update"></span>PRESENCE_UPDATE

One visible presence changed. The payload is a [presence object](#presence-object).

A session receives a presence for a friend, for a recipient of a group direct message it belongs to, and for a guild member it subscribed to through the `members` array of a [Lazy Request](/gateway/commands/#lazy-request). A bot session holds no friend or group direct message subscription, so the guild path is the only one that reaches it.

Presence Updates normally follow [Ready](#ready). The initial Presence Update burst omits users already included in Ready. If Ready takes more than 10,000 ms, Presence Updates can arrive before it.

Later presences can be delayed until their guild, relationship, or group direct message becomes visible. They may arrive after [Relationship Add](#relationship-add), [Relationship Update](#relationship-update), [Channel Create](#channel-create), [Channel Update](#channel-update), or [Channel Recipient Add](#channel-recipient-add). Delivery is not guaranteed for a subject that never becomes visible.

#### Presence object

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| user | [partial user](/http-api/users/#partial-user-object) object | The user the presence belongs to |
| status | string | `online`, `idle`, `dnd`, or `offline` |
| mobile | boolean | Whether the user's active status comes from a mobile session |
| afk | boolean | Whether every one of the user's sessions is away |
| custom_status | ?[custom status object](#custom-status-object) | The user's custom status |
| guild_id? | snowflake | Guild context, present when the presence arrived through a guild |

An account's published `status` is the highest-precedence status across its live sessions, resolved in the order `dnd`, `online`, `idle`, `invisible`, and finally `offline` when no session is live. A session that selected `invisible`, and an account with no live session, both publish `status: "offline"`. A session that lost its transport is published as `offline` 5,000 ms later, even though it stays resumable for the rest of its 60,000 ms retention window. A successful [Resume](/gateway/commands/#resume) republishes the status it last selected.

`mobile` is true only when the account's resolved status is `online` and at least one online session declared itself mobile. `afk` is false whenever `mobile` is true. Otherwise it is true only when every live session is away.

`custom_status` is suppressed to `null` whenever the published status is `offline`, so an invisible account never reveals one.

#### Custom status object

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| text | ?string | Custom status text |
| expires_at | ?ISO8601 timestamp | When the custom status expires |
| emoji_id | ?snowflake | Custom emoji ID |
| emoji_name | ?string | Unicode emoji, or the custom emoji's name |
| emoji_animated | boolean | Whether the custom emoji is animated |

### <span id="presence-update-bulk"></span>PRESENCE_UPDATE_BULK

Several visible presences are delivered in one Dispatch. A guild sends this only when it leaves the unavailable state. Every session that stayed connected receives it immediately after the [Guild Create](#guild-create) that restores the guild.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| guild_id | snowflake | Guild context applied to every entry |
| presences<sup>1</sup> | array[[presence object](#presence-object)] | The presences, at most 500 per Dispatch |

<sup>1</sup> Only visibly online presences are included, and the recipient's own presence is removed. A batch that would be empty produces no Dispatch, and a set larger than 500 is split across consecutive Dispatches

Every entry has the batch's guild context. A client MUST treat each entry as if it named `guild_id` itself.

### <span id="passive-updates"></span>PASSIVE_UPDATES

A passive session in a guild with more than 250 members receives missed changes every 30,000 ms. No event is sent when nothing changed.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| guild_id | snowflake | Guild the update covers |
| channels | map[snowflake, snowflake] | Changed `last_message_id` per channel |
| voice_states?<sup>1</sup> | array[[voice state object](#voice-state-object)] | Changed voice states in channels the session can view |

<sup>1</sup> Omitted when the set would be empty. A participant that left a viewable channel since the previous cycle appears here with `channel_id` set to null

`channels` contains only the channels whose `last_message_id` changed since the previous update for that session, and only channels that session can view. `voice_states` contains only the voice states whose `version` advanced.

## Messages and reactions

### <span id="message-create"></span>MESSAGE_CREATE

A visible message was created. The payload is the complete [message object](/http-api/messages/#message-object) with the fields below added.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| channel_type | integer | [Channel type](/http-api/channels/#channel-types) of the channel the message was created in |
| nicks? | map[snowflake, string] | Group direct message nicknames, present only for a group direct message that stores at least one |
| mention_here? | boolean | Always `true` when present, and present only when the message has a here mention |
| guild_id? | snowflake | Guild the channel belongs to |
| member?<sup>1</sup> | [guild member](/http-api/guild-members/#guild-member-object) object | The author's guild member object, present in a guild channel |

<sup>1</sup> The `user` field is removed from it, and the account is in the message's `author`

Message Create alone overrides both the passive filter and the `ignored_events` list, and the two use different tests. A direct mention, a mention of one of the user's roles, an everyone mention, or a here mention overrides the passive filter. A direct, everyone, or here mention alone overrides the `ignored_events` list.

### <span id="message-update"></span>MESSAGE_UPDATE

A visible message changed. The payload is the complete current [message object](/http-api/messages/#message-object), with no `channel_type`, `nicks`, or `mention_here`. In a guild channel it is extended with `guild_id` and with `member`, the author's guild member object with its `user` field removed.

Recipients must hold `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` on the channel, or the message must be newer than the guild's message history cutoff.

### <span id="message-delete"></span>MESSAGE_DELETE

One visible message was deleted.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | snowflake | The deleted message |
| channel_id | snowflake | Channel the message was in |
| content?<sup>1</sup> | ?string | Content the message held before it was deleted |
| author_id?<sup>1</sup> | snowflake | Account that wrote the message |
| guild_id? | snowflake | Guild the channel belongs to |
| member?<sup>2</sup> | [guild member](/http-api/guild-members/#guild-member-object) object | The author's guild member object, present in a guild channel |

<sup>1</sup> Both fields are omitted when an instance administrator deleted the message through the Admin API, when Fluxer deleted it after a CSAM report, or when Fluxer deleted it because content moderation blocked a link preview in it, and `author_id` is also omitted for a message with no author

<sup>2</sup> The `user` field is removed from it, and the whole field is absent when `author_id` is absent or the author is no longer a member

### <span id="message-delete-bulk"></span>MESSAGE_DELETE_BULK

Several messages in one channel were deleted together.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ids | array[snowflake] | The deleted messages |
| channel_id | snowflake | Channel the messages were in |
| guild_id? | snowflake | Guild the channel belongs to |

### <span id="message-ack"></span>MESSAGE_ACK

The current user's read state advanced for a channel, usually because another of the account's sessions read it.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| channel_id | snowflake | Channel whose read state advanced |
| message_id | snowflake | Message the read state now points at |
| mention_count | integer | Remaining mention count for the channel |
| manual? | boolean | Whether the acknowledgement was explicit |
| version? | string | Read state version as a decimal string |

### <span id="message-reaction-add"></span>MESSAGE_REACTION_ADD

A user added a reaction to a message.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| user_id | snowflake | User that reacted |
| channel_id | snowflake | Channel the message is in |
| message_id | snowflake | Message that was reacted to |
| emoji | [reaction emoji object](#reaction-emoji-object) | The emoji |
| guild_id? | snowflake | Guild the channel belongs to |
| member? | [guild member](/http-api/guild-members/#guild-member-object) object | The reacting user's guild member object, present in a guild channel |

In a guild channel the session named by the request's `session_id` is excluded and that field is removed from the payload. In a private channel the field is delivered as `session_id` and excludes nobody, so a client MUST tolerate receiving its own reaction back.

#### Reaction emoji object

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | string | Unicode emoji, or the custom emoji's name |
| id? | snowflake | Custom emoji ID, absent for a Unicode emoji |
| animated?<sup>1</sup> | boolean | Whether the custom emoji is animated |

<sup>1</sup> Present only on the [Message Reaction Add](#message-reaction-add) that creates the first reaction with that emoji on the message. An addition to an emoji that already has a reactor, a [Message Reaction Remove](#message-reaction-remove), and a [Message Reaction Remove Emoji](#message-reaction-remove-emoji) omit the field

Neither `id` nor `animated` is ever null. A Unicode reaction omits both, so a client distinguishes the forms by the presence of `id`. A client MUST NOT read an absent `animated` as `false`.

### <span id="message-reaction-add-many"></span>MESSAGE_REACTION_ADD_MANY

With the `DEBOUNCE_MESSAGE_REACTIONS` [session flag](/gateway/commands/#session-flags), private-channel additions are grouped over 650 ms and delivered together. Each window keeps the latest 512 additions. Guild-channel additions always arrive as individual [Message Reaction Add](#message-reaction-add) events.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| channel_id<sup>1</sup> | snowflake | Channel the message is in |
| message_id<sup>1</sup> | snowflake | Message that was reacted to |
| guild_id?<sup>1</sup> | snowflake | Guild the channel belongs to |
| reactions | array[[reaction addition object](#reaction-addition-object)] | The merged additions, in arrival order |

<sup>1</sup> Every addition in `reactions` belongs to this message. A window covering several messages produces a separate Dispatch for each

When the window closes holding exactly one addition, Fluxer sends [Message Reaction Add](#message-reaction-add) to the session. A session without the flag receives one Message Reaction Add per addition.

#### Reaction addition object

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| user_id | snowflake | User that reacted |
| emoji | [reaction emoji object](#reaction-emoji-object) | The emoji |
| member? | [guild member](/http-api/guild-members/#guild-member-object) object | The reacting user's guild member object, present in a guild channel |

### <span id="message-reaction-remove"></span>MESSAGE_REACTION_REMOVE

One user's reaction was removed from a message.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| user_id | snowflake | User whose reaction was removed |
| channel_id | snowflake | Channel the message is in |
| message_id | snowflake | Message the reaction was on |
| emoji | [reaction emoji object](#reaction-emoji-object) | The emoji |
| guild_id? | snowflake | Guild the channel belongs to |
| member? | [guild member](/http-api/guild-members/#guild-member-object) object | The user's guild member object, present in a guild channel |

Exclusion works exactly as it does for [Message Reaction Add](#message-reaction-add), so the acting session is dropped in a guild channel and kept in a private one.

With reaction debouncing enabled, an addition removed within the same window produces neither event for that message, user, and emoji.

### <span id="message-reaction-remove-all"></span>MESSAGE_REACTION_REMOVE_ALL

Every reaction was removed from a message at once.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| channel_id | snowflake | Channel the message is in |
| message_id | snowflake | Message whose reactions were cleared |
| guild_id? | snowflake | Guild the channel belongs to |

### <span id="message-reaction-remove-emoji"></span>MESSAGE_REACTION_REMOVE_EMOJI

Every reaction using one emoji was removed from a message.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| channel_id | snowflake | Channel the message is in |
| message_id | snowflake | Message the reactions were on |
| emoji | [reaction emoji object](#reaction-emoji-object) | The emoji whose reactions were removed |
| guild_id? | snowflake | Guild the channel belongs to |

### <span id="typing-start"></span>TYPING_START

A visible user began typing in a channel.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| channel_id | snowflake | Channel the user is typing in |
| user_id | snowflake | User that started typing |
| timestamp | integer | Unix seconds when typing started |
| guild_id? | snowflake | Guild the channel belongs to |
| member? | [guild member](/http-api/guild-members/#guild-member-object) object | The typing user's guild member object, present in a guild channel |

The `typing` override set through [Lazy Request](/gateway/commands/#lazy-request) decides delivery in a guild. With no override, a session receives the event when it is [active](/gateway/event-filtering/#active-and-passive-guilds) in the guild or when the guild has 250 members or fewer, so a passive session in a small guild still receives it. A guild that sets the `TYPING_EVENTS` bit in its [disabled operations](/http-api/guilds/#disabled-guild-operations) produces the event for nobody.

### <span id="channel-pins-update"></span>CHANNEL_PINS_UPDATE

A channel's most recent pin time changed.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| channel_id | snowflake | Channel whose pins changed |
| last_pin_timestamp | ?ISO8601 timestamp | Time of the most recent pin, null when nothing is pinned |
| guild_id? | snowflake | Guild the channel belongs to |

### <span id="channel-pins-ack"></span>CHANNEL_PINS_ACK

The current user acknowledged a channel's pins. Every session of the account receives it, including the one that issued the acknowledgement.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| channel_id | snowflake | Channel whose pins were acknowledged |
| timestamp | ISO8601 timestamp | Time the acknowledgement recorded for the channel |

## Voice and calls

### <span id="voice-state-update"></span>VOICE_STATE_UPDATE

A participant's voice state changed. The payload is a [voice state object](#voice-state-object).

Recipients are the sessions that can view the voice channel, passive sessions included. A passive session in a guild with more than 250 members also receives the changed voice states through [Passive Updates](#passive-updates).

A `channel_id` of null means the participant left.

#### Voice state object

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| guild_id | ?snowflake | Guild the voice channel belongs to, null in a call |
| channel_id | ?snowflake | Voice channel, null when the participant left |
| user_id | ?snowflake | Participant |
| connection_id | ?string | Voice connection identity |
| session_id | ?string | Gateway session that owns the connection |
| member | ?[guild member](/http-api/guild-members/#guild-member-object) object | The participant's guild member object, null in a call |
| mute | boolean | Server mute |
| deaf | boolean | Server deafen |
| self_mute | boolean | Local microphone mute |
| self_deaf | boolean | Local output deafen |
| self_video | boolean | Whether the participant publishes camera video |
| self_stream<sup>1</sup> | boolean | Whether the connection advertises a screenshare track |
| is_mobile | boolean | Whether the participant is on a mobile client |
| suppress | boolean | Whether the participant is suppressed |
| viewer_stream_keys | array[string] | Streams this connection is watching |
| e2ee_capable | boolean | Whether the participant's client supports end-to-end encrypted voice |
| version | integer | Monotonic version of this participant's voice state |

<sup>1</sup> The participant's client reports this value. In a guild voice channel Fluxer sets it to false when the participant lacks `STREAM`

The broadcast form has no `region_id`, `server_id`, `latitude`, or `longitude`.

### <span id="voice-server-update"></span>VOICE_SERVER_UPDATE

The session received or replaced its own voice grant. Delivered to the requesting session alone.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| token | string | The LiveKit access token this connection presents |
| endpoint | string | The LiveKit signalling URL to connect to, a `ws://` or `wss://` address |
| connection_id | string | The voice connection the grant covers |
| channel_id | snowflake | The channel the grant covers |
| guild_id?<sup>1</sup> | snowflake | The guild the channel belongs to |
| e2ee_key?<sup>2</sup> | string | The key material the channel's end-to-end encryption uses |

<sup>1</sup> Present for a guild voice channel and absent for a call, so a client reads the scope from this field

<sup>2</sup> Present only when the channel is end-to-end encrypted

Fluxer uses LiveKit for voice media. There is no second voice websocket, no voice opcode set, and no UDP discovery step. A client opens a LiveKit connection to `endpoint`, presents `token` there, and speaks the LiveKit protocol from that point on. [Voice](/voice/) states the room naming, the participant identity, and the track sources a grant admits.

A grant is issued when a connection opens, when it moves to another channel, and when its region changes. Toggling `self_mute`, `self_video`, or `self_stream` produces no new grant. A call region change reissues one grant to each participant of the call.

### <span id="entrance-sound-play"></span>ENTRANCE_SOUND_PLAY

A participant asked for their entrance sound to play in a voice channel they are already connected to.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| user_id | snowflake | Participant whose sound plays |
| channel_id | snowflake | Voice channel |
| guild_id | ?snowflake | Guild the channel belongs to, null for a call |
| sound_id | snowflake | Entrance sound |
| hash | string | Content hash of the sound file |
| url | string | URL to fetch the sound from |
| duration_ms | integer | Sound duration in milliseconds |
| content_type | string | MIME type of the sound file |

Recipients are every other account with a voice state in that channel, one Dispatch each and at most one per account. The requesting account never receives its own sound.

### <span id="call-create"></span>CALL_CREATE

A private channel call began, or became visible in the session's initial state.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| channel_id | snowflake | Channel the call is in |
| message_id | snowflake | Call message that opened the call |
| region | ?string | Voice region serving the call, null until one is chosen |
| ringing | array[snowflake] | Recipients being rung |
| voice_states<sup>1</sup> | array[[voice state object](#voice-state-object)] | Participants, ordered by participant ID |
| recipients?<sup>2</sup> | array[snowflake] | Every recipient of the channel |
| created_at?<sup>2</sup> | integer | Unix milliseconds when the call was opened |

<sup>1</sup> Entries also include `region_id` and `server_id`, which clients MUST ignore

<sup>2</sup> Present on initial or recovered call state

Initial call state arrives shortly after [Ready](#ready). Recovered state can arrive after a lost call connection, whether or not the client received [Call Delete](#call-delete).

Recipients are every recipient of the channel, whether or not they joined the call. The same set receives [Call Update](#call-update) and [Call Delete](#call-delete).

### <span id="call-update"></span>CALL_UPDATE

The ringing set, participant roster, or region of an active call changed. The payload has the same structure as [Call Create](#call-create) without `recipients` and `created_at`.

An operation with no visible effect produces no Call Update.

### <span id="call-delete"></span>CALL_DELETE

A call ended, or became unavailable.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| channel_id | snowflake | Channel the call was in |
| unavailable?<sup>1</sup> | boolean | True when the call became unavailable |

<sup>1</sup> Absent when the call ended

With `unavailable: true`, the client MUST keep the call as an unavailable entry. If it becomes available again, a fresh [Call Create](#call-create) includes `recipients` and `created_at`. Recovery is not guaranteed.

## Count response events

### <span id="guild-counts-update"></span>GUILD_COUNTS_UPDATE

Answers [Request Guild Counts](/gateway/commands/#request-guild-counts) for the requesting session.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| counts | array[[guild count entry object](#guild-count-entry-object)] | One entry per guild that answered in time |
| nonce? | string | Echoed when the request supplied a valid nonce |

A guild that is not connected, or that missed its deadline, has no entry in `counts`.

#### Guild count entry object

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| guild_id | snowflake | Guild the counts describe |
| member_count | integer | Total members |
| online_count<sup>1</sup> | integer | Online members visible to the requesting account |

<sup>1</sup> Counts only the online members that share at least one channel the requesting account can view. An account holding `ADMINISTRATOR` receives the guild's whole online count instead, and an account that can view no channel receives `1` when it is itself online and `0` when it is not

### <span id="channel-member-counts-update"></span>CHANNEL_MEMBER_COUNTS_UPDATE

Answers [Request Channel Member Counts](/gateway/commands/#request-channel-member-counts) for the requesting session.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| counts | array[[channel count entry object](#channel-count-entry-object)] | One entry per channel that answered |
| nonce? | string | Echoed when the request supplied a valid nonce |

A channel the session cannot view, and a channel on which it lacks `VIEW_CHANNEL_MEMBERS`, has no entry in `counts`.

#### Channel count entry object

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| guild_id | snowflake | Guild the channel belongs to |
| channel_id | snowflake | Channel the counts describe |
| member_count | integer | Members that can view the channel |
| online_count | integer | Online members that can view the channel |

## Resource representation

Every resource object named on this page has the representation defined by the [HTTP API](/http-api/). A Dispatch payload with a resource object has the same fields, with the guild-scoped events adding `guild_id` and the message and reaction events adding `member`.

These reductions are specific to the Gateway and appear nowhere in the HTTP API. [Ready](#ready) strips `user` from each relationship and from each guild member and moves those accounts into its `users` array. The `member` added to a message event has its own `user` removed, and the account is in the message's `author`. A client MUST resolve those accounts from the surrounding payload.
