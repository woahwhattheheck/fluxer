title: User settings Protobuf
description: The client preference snapshot in the user settings object.
---

A synced preferences snapshot holds the client settings an account shares between its devices. It is one base64-encoded `fluxer.user.preferences.v1.SyncedPreferences` message in the `synced_preferences` field of the [user settings object](/http-api/users/#user-settings-object). Fluxer stores it and interprets no field on this page.

## Reading and writing the snapshot

Decode the string before reading any preference, and encode a valid `SyncedPreferences` message when writing one. [Modify current user settings](/http-api/users/settings/#modify-current-user-settings) takes the complete snapshot every time.

The empty string in a response means nothing is stored. Sending null or the empty string clears it. A stored snapshot reaches the account's other sessions through [User Settings Update](/gateway/events/#user-settings-update).

A returned snapshot can have a different encoding from the submitted one. Unknown fields and enum values survive the round trip. A snapshot containing only default values is returned as the empty string.

A submission may use either the standard or the URL-safe base64 alphabet, with or without padding. Fluxer always returns the standard alphabet with padding.

## How to read the type column

Types here are the declared Protobuf types. A field whose declared type is an enumeration appears as `int32`, its wire representation, and the Description column links the enumeration.

A field without the optional marker always decodes and holds its Protobuf zero value. That is false for a bool, 0 for a numeric type, the empty string, an empty repeated field, or an empty map. A field with the optional marker tracks presence and is absent until a value is stored. Every singular message field tracks presence the same way, so a preference group is absent from the snapshot until a client writes to it.

Fluxer applies no bound to any individual field of the message, so every length, range, and enumeration membership below describes what the first-party client writes and reads.

## Rejection grounds

Fluxer reports every entry in the resulting `errors` array against the path `synced_preferences`. It checks the encoded string first.

| Condition | Status and code | Element codes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Encoded string longer than 699052 characters | 400 `INVALID_FORM_BODY` | `CONTENT_EXCEEDS_MAX_LENGTH` and `INVALID_FORMAT` |
| Encoded string outside the base64 alphabet | 400 `INVALID_FORM_BODY` | `INVALID_FORMAT` |
| Decoded message above 524288 bytes | 400 `VALIDATION_ERROR` | `TOO_LARGE` |
| Bytes that do not decode as `SyncedPreferences` | 400 `VALIDATION_ERROR` | `INVALID_FORMAT` |

An over-length string draws two entries for the one path.

## Synced preferences object

`SyncedPreferences` is the root message. Most fields are preference groups. Use the Protobuf schema for field numbers, not their position in this table.

<sup>1</sup> The entries live inside the snapshot, and the account [memes](/http-api/memes/) collection holds none of them

<sup>2</sup> The only bare scalar on the root message, so it has no presence and reads as false until a client stores true. It applies to the content a client is about to send, and the first-party client leaves the URLs inside inline code and code blocks unchanged

<sup>3</sup> Holds only which folders are expanded. The folder layout itself is `guild_folders` on the [user settings object](/http-api/users/#user-settings-object)

<sup>4</sup> The only optional scalar on the root message, so it tracks presence. No live surface reads or writes it

## Accessibility settings object

The `accessibility` field has display, motion, message, media, voice, and interaction preferences. Almost every field is optional, so distinguish an absent field from a stored zero value before applying a default.

<sup>1</sup> A multiplier applied to interface colour, where 1 leaves colour unchanged

<sup>2</sup> Read only while `sync_reduced_motion_with_system` is false

<sup>3</sup> A length in CSS pixels. The first-party client defaults to 16 for `message_group_spacing`, `message_gutter`, and `font_size`, and to 0 for `compact_message_group_spacing`

<sup>4</sup> The paired `mobile_*_value` field is read only while this flag is true, and only on a mobile layout. While the flag is false the first-party client falls back to the account-level setting for emoji animation, and to a fixed mobile default for GIF autoplay and sticker animation

<sup>5</sup> The same enumeration as `animate_stickers` on the [user settings object](/http-api/users/#user-settings-object). This field is the mobile-local replacement

<sup>6</sup> The complete CSS of the account's synced custom theme, stored inline. A client that has opted out of syncing its theme applies a local one instead and re-emits this value unchanged, so it does not overwrite the value on the devices that do sync

<sup>7</sup> A multiplier, where 1 is unscaled. Unused by the first-party client

<sup>8</sup> A multiplier, where 1 is the unmodified speaking rate

Field numbers 42 and 43 are reserved, together with the names `attachment_media_dimension_size` and `embed_media_dimension_size`. Neither number can be reused.

### Channel typing indicator modes

| 2 | HDR_DISPLAY_MODE_STANDARD | Limit HDR media to standard dynamic range |

## Accessibility overrides object

The `accessibility_overrides` field is unused by the first-party client. Use the `mobile_*_overridden` and matching `mobile_*_value` fields in [accessibility settings](#accessibility-settings-object).

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| gif_autoplay_dirty | bool | GIF autoplay dirty flag |
| animate_emoji_dirty | bool | Emoji animation dirty flag |
| animate_stickers_dirty | bool | Sticker animation dirty flag |

## Textual preview settings object

The `textual_preview` field controls line wrapping in the inline preview of a textual attachment.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| wrap_text | bool | Whether long lines wrap in a textual preview |

## Usage stat object

The usage stat object records picker usage for one expression or one meme. It is the map value of the `usage` field in every picker state group, so the emoji, sticker, and meme pickers all rank their entries from the same shape.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| count | uint32 | Number of recorded uses |
| last_used_ms<sup>1</sup> | int64 | Unix timestamp in milliseconds of the most recent use |

<sup>1</sup> Milliseconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z

## Emoji picker state object

The `emoji_picker` field records emoji usage, favourites, and collapsed picker categories.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| usage<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup> | map[string, [usage stat](#usage-stat-object) object] | Usage keyed by emoji usage key |
| favorite_emoji_ids<sup>1</sup> | array[string] | Favourite emoji usage keys in display order |
| collapsed_category_ids | array[string] | Collapsed emoji category identifiers |

<sup>1</sup> The first-party client writes `unicode:<unique name>` for a standard emoji and `custom:<guild id>:<emoji id>` for a custom emoji

<sup>2</sup> The first-party client drops a key matching neither form when it reads the snapshot, and applies no such filter to `favorite_emoji_ids`

## Sticker picker state object

The `sticker_picker` field records sticker usage, favourites, and collapsed picker categories.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| usage | map[string, [usage stat](#usage-stat-object) object] | Usage keyed by sticker identifier |
| favorite_sticker_ids | array[string] | Favourite sticker identifiers in display order |
| collapsed_category_ids | array[string] | Collapsed sticker category identifiers |

## Memes picker state object

The `memes_picker` field records meme usage, favourites, and collapsed picker categories. The memes themselves belong to the account [memes](/http-api/memes/) collection and are not stored here.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| usage | map[string, [usage stat](#usage-stat-object) object] | Usage keyed by meme identifier |
| favorite_meme_ids | array[string] | Favourite meme identifiers in display order |
| collapsed_category_ids | array[string] | Collapsed meme category identifiers |

## Emoji state object

The `emoji` field holds the selected skin tone.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| skin_tone<sup>1</sup> | string | Selected Unicode skin tone modifier |

<sup>1</sup> One of the five Unicode skin tone modifiers, U+1F3FB through U+1F3FF. The empty string selects the default tone

## Emoji and sticker layout settings object

The `emoji_sticker_layout` field controls how the emoji and sticker pickers lay out their contents.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| emoji_layout | int32 | [Emoji picker layout](#emoji-picker-layouts) |
| sticker_view_mode | int32 | [Sticker picker view mode](#sticker-picker-view-modes) |

### Emoji picker layouts

| 1 | STICKER_PICKER_VIEW_MODE_COZY | Display stickers with the roomy layout |
| 2 | STICKER_PICKER_VIEW_MODE_COMPACT | Display stickers with the compact layout |

## Favourite GIF settings object

The `favorite_gifs` field stores the GIFs the account has favourited, together with the metadata needed to render one without another lookup. Favouriting a GIF writes an entry here or writes a meme to the account [memes](/http-api/memes/) collection, never both, and `save_as_saved_media` selects which.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| entries<sup>1</sup> | array[[favourite GIF entry](#favourite-gif-entry-object) object] | Favourite GIFs in display order |
| save_as_saved_media<sup>2</sup> | bool | Whether favouriting a GIF saves a meme to the account memes collection |
| seen_first_time_prompt | bool | Whether the first-time favourite prompt has been shown |

<sup>1</sup> The first-party client treats `url` as the identity of an entry and refuses to append a second entry with a `url` already present

<sup>2</sup> While this is true the first-party client leaves `entries` untouched and favourites through [Save meme from message](/http-api/memes/#save-meme-from-message) instead

## Favourite GIF entry object

One entry describes one favourited GIF. Its fields mirror the [resolved GIF entry object](/http-api/memes/#resolved-gif-entry-object) returned by [Resolve GIF URLs](/http-api/memes/#resolve-gif-urls), so a client can store a resolved entry without reshaping it.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| url | string | Source URL of the GIF |
| proxy_url | string | [Media Proxy](/media-proxy/overview/) URL for the preview format |
| width<sup>1</sup> | uint32 | Width of the preview format in pixels |
| height<sup>1</sup> | uint32 | Height of the preview format in pixels |
| media | map[string, [favourite GIF media format](#favourite-gif-media-format-object) object] | Formats keyed by [GIF media format name](/http-api/memes/#gif-media-format-names) |
| content_type<sup>2</sup> | string | Media type of the media addressed by `proxy_url` |
| placeholder<sup>3</sup> | string | Compact thumbhash placeholder |

<sup>1</sup> Zero when the dimensions could not be determined

<sup>2</sup> The empty string means the type is unknown, which a client reads as `image/gif`

<sup>3</sup> The empty string means the Media Proxy emitted none

## Favourite GIF media format object

One descriptor addresses one encoding of one favourited GIF. It mirrors the [GIF media format object](/http-api/memes/#gif-media-format-object).

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| src | string | Direct media URL of this format |
| proxy_src | string | [Media Proxy](/media-proxy/overview/) URL of this format |
| width | uint32 | Width of this format in pixels |
| height | uint32 | Height of this format in pixels |

## Favourites state object

The `favorites` field stores favourite channels, the categories they are grouped into, and the display state of that grouping. These categories are private to the favourites view.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| channels | array[[favourite channel](#favourite-channel-object) object] | Favourite channels |
| categories | array[[favourite category](#favourite-category-object) object] | Favourite categories |
| collapsed_category_ids | array[string] | Collapsed favourite category identifiers |
| hide_muted_channels | bool | Whether muted channels are hidden from favourites |
| muted | bool | Whether the favourites collection is muted |

## Favourite channel object

One entry marks one channel as a favourite. Channel and guild identifiers here are strings holding the decimal form of a [snowflake](/snowflakes/). Nothing removes an entry when the account loses access to the channel, so an entry can reference a channel the account can no longer resolve.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| channel_id | string | Channel ID |
| guild_id | string | Guild ID |
| parent_id?<sup>1</sup> | string | Favourite category the channel is grouped under |
| position<sup>2</sup> | int32 | Position across the whole favourites list |
| nickname? | string | User-assigned channel nickname |

<sup>1</sup> The `id` of a [favourite category](#favourite-category-object), not a guild category channel. An absent value groups the channel outside every category

<sup>2</sup> A single ordering over every favourite channel. The first-party client renumbers the whole list from 0 whenever an entry is removed or moved, and appends a new entry at the current entry count without renumbering

## Favourite category object

One entry names one grouping in the favourites view. The client chooses the identifier, so it is not a [snowflake](/snowflakes/) and Fluxer never resolves it.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | string | Category identifier |
| name | string | Category name |
| position<sup>1</sup> | int32 | Category position |

<sup>1</sup> Renumbered from 0 across every category whenever one is removed or moved

## Recent mentions settings object

The `recent_mentions` field controls which mentions appear in the recent mentions view. Each filter set to false removes its mentions, and a mention appears only when no filter removes it. `include_guilds` tests the channel the mention is in.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| include_everyone?<sup>1</sup> | bool | Whether to include `@everyone` mentions |
| include_roles?<sup>1</sup> | bool | Whether to include role mentions |
| include_guilds?<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup> | bool | Whether to include mentions in a guild channel |

<sup>1</sup> The first-party client defaults every filter to true and omits the field while it holds that default. A client that reads an absent value as the Protobuf zero then filters out mentions the account expects to see

<sup>2</sup> False keeps direct message mentions and drops every mention whose channel belongs to a guild

## Sidebar preferences object

The `sidebar` field stores direct message sidebar display state.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| inline_dms_collapsed | bool | Whether the inline direct message section is collapsed |
| show_collapsed_unread_dms_badge?<sup>1</sup> | bool | Whether the collapsed section shows an unread direct message badge |
| show_incoming_friend_request_badge?<sup>1</sup> | bool | Whether the sidebar shows an incoming friend request badge |

<sup>1</sup> The first-party client defaults it to true and omits the field while it holds that default, so a client that reads an absent value as the Protobuf zero hides a badge the account expects to see

## Member list state object

The `member_list` field stores whether the member list panel is open.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| members_open? | bool | Whether the member list is open |

## Unread channels state object

The `unread_channels` field stores which channels are collapsed in the unread view.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| collapsed_channel_ids | array[string] | Collapsed channel IDs in decimal form |

## Mention frecency state object

The `mention_frecency` field records how often and how recently the account mentioned each user, one record set per guild, so a client can rank mention autocomplete without a server call. It nests the messages `MentionFrecencyState.Scope` and `MentionFrecencyState.Entry`.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| scopes | array[[mention frecency scope](#mention-frecency-scope-object) object] | Per-guild mention records |

## Mention frecency scope object

One scope holds every mention record for one guild. It is declared as `MentionFrecencyState.Scope`.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| guild_id | string | Guild ID in decimal form |
| entries | array[[mention frecency entry](#mention-frecency-entry-object) object] | User mention records for the guild |

## Mention frecency entry object

One entry counts mentions of one user inside one scope. It is declared as `MentionFrecencyState.Entry`.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| user_id | string | Mentioned user ID in decimal form |
| count | uint32 | Number of recorded mentions |
| last_at_ms<sup>1</sup> | int64 | Unix timestamp in milliseconds of the most recent mention |

<sup>1</sup> Milliseconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z

## Nagbar dismissals object

The `nagbars` field stores dismissed account-wide notices as bools and dismissed per-target notices as maps. Field number 13 is not assigned.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ios_install | bool | Whether the iOS installation notice is dismissed |
| pwa_install | bool | Whether the progressive web application installation notice is dismissed |
| push_notification | bool | Whether the push notification notice is dismissed |
| desktop_notification | bool | Whether the desktop notification notice is dismissed |
| premium_grace_period | bool | Whether the premium grace period notice is dismissed |
| premium_expired | bool | Whether the premium expiry notice is dismissed |
| premium_onboarding | bool | Whether the premium onboarding notice is dismissed |
| premium_trial_expiring | bool | Whether the premium trial expiry notice is dismissed |
| gift_inventory | bool | Whether the gift inventory notice is dismissed |
| desktop_download | bool | Whether the desktop download notice is dismissed |
| guild_membership_cta | bool | Whether the guild membership call to action notice is dismissed |
| visionary_mfa<sup>1</sup> | bool | Whether the lifetime premium MFA notice is dismissed |
| legacy_phone_unlink | bool | Whether the legacy phone unlink notice is dismissed |
| pending_bulk_deletion | map[string, bool] | Dismissal state keyed by pending bulk deletion identifier |
| invites_disabled<sup>2</sup> | map[string, bool] | Dismissal state keyed by guild ID for disabled-invite notices |
| guild_mfa_requirement<sup>2</sup> | map[string, bool] | Dismissal state keyed by guild ID for MFA requirement notices |

<sup>1</sup> The notice this dismisses is shown only to an account holding lifetime premium with no MFA authenticator enrolled

<sup>2</sup> Keyed by the decimal form of a guild [snowflake](/snowflakes/). A missing key reads as not dismissed

## Dismissed upsells object

The `dismissed_upsells` field stores dismissed upsells.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| picker_premium | bool | Whether the premium picker upsell is dismissed |

## Guild mature content agreements object

The `guild_nsfw_agreements` field stores mature content acknowledgements. Acceptance is recorded per target, so accepting for a guild does not record acceptance for its categories or channels.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| agreed_channel_ids | array[string] | Channel IDs whose mature content notice was accepted |
| agreed_guild_ids | array[string] | Guild IDs whose mature content notice was accepted |
| agreed_category_ids | array[string] | Category IDs whose mature content notice was accepted |

## What's new state object

The `whats_new` field stores the most recently dismissed update entry.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| last_dismissed_entry_id? | string | Most recently dismissed update entry ID |

## Privacy preferences object

The `privacy` field stores client privacy behaviour. Fluxer reads none of it, and none of it changes the privacy fields of the [user settings object](/http-api/users/#user-settings-object), which control what Fluxer itself discloses about the account.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| disable_stream_previews<sup>1</sup> | bool | Whether stream previews are disabled |
| show_active_now? | bool | Whether the active now view is shown |
| preupload_message_attachments? | bool | Whether message attachments are uploaded before the message is sent |

<sup>1</sup> The only field in this group whose effect reaches past the account's own view. While it is true the first-party client uploads no stream preview frame, so no other viewer receives one

## Local user spam overrides object

The `local_spam_overrides` field stores client-local classifications that override the [SPAMMER public user flag](/http-api/users/#public-user-flags) in display only. Fluxer neither reads these lists nor changes any flag because of them.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| spammer_user_ids | array[string] | User IDs presented locally as spammers |
| not_spammer_user_ids<sup>1</sup> | array[string] | User IDs presented locally as not being spammers |

<sup>1</sup> This list wins over `spammer_user_ids` and over the `SPAMMER` flag, so a user ID present in both lists is presented as not a spammer

## Sound settings object

The `sound` field controls sound playback, master volume, and per-sound overrides.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| all_sounds_disabled | bool | Whether every application sound is disabled |
| master_volume?<sup>1</sup> | double | Master sound volume |
| disabled_sounds | map[string, bool] | Disabled state keyed by [sound identifier](#sound-identifiers) |
| sound_overrides<sup>2</sup> | map[string, double] | Volume override keyed by [sound identifier](#sound-identifiers) |

<sup>1</sup> A percentage. The first-party client clamps it to the range 0 through 200, treats 100 as the default, and omits the field entirely while it holds the default

<sup>2</sup> A percentage on the same scale, and the complete volume for that one sound

### Sound identifiers

Both maps are keyed by an arbitrary string, and Fluxer stores and returns any key unchanged. The first-party client uses the identifiers below, and the first-party client ignores a key outside this set.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| deaf | Deafening sound |
| undeaf | Undeafening sound |
| mute | Muting sound |
| unmute | Unmuting sound |
| message | Message notification sound |
| direct-message | Direct message notification sound |
| same-channel-message | Notification sound for the channel already in view |
| incoming-ring | Incoming call sound |
| user-join | Voice participant join sound |
| user-leave | Voice participant leave sound |
| user-move | Voice participant move sound |
| viewer-join | Stream viewer join sound |
| viewer-leave | Stream viewer leave sound |
| voice-disconnect | Voice disconnection sound |
| camera-on | Camera enabled sound |
| camera-off | Camera disabled sound |
| screen-share-start | Screen share start sound |
| screen-share-stop | Screen share stop sound |

## Spellcheck settings object

The `spellcheck` field controls spellchecking, the selected languages, and the personal dictionary.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| enabled? | bool | Whether spellchecking is enabled |
| languages<sup>1</sup> | array[string] | Selected spellcheck languages |
| personal_dictionary<sup>1</sup> | array[string] | Words in the personal dictionary |
| auto_detect? | bool | Whether spellcheck languages are detected automatically |
| engine?<sup>2</sup> | string | Selected spellcheck engine identifier |

<sup>1</sup> The first-party client drops an empty entry and a duplicate entry when it reads the snapshot

<sup>2</sup> The first-party client recognises `auto`, `system`, and `hunspell`, and ignores any other value

## Search engine settings object

The `search_engines` field stores the selected external providers. Every identifier names a provider the client defines, and Fluxer neither validates nor resolves one.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| text_search_engine_id? | string | Text search engine identifier |
| reverse_image_search_engine_id? | string | Reverse image search engine identifier |
| translation_provider_id? | string | Translation provider identifier |

## Permission layout settings object

The `permission_layout` field controls the layout of the [permission](/http-api/permissions/) editor.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| layout | int32 | [Permission layout mode](#permission-layout-modes) |
| grid | int32 | [Permission grid mode](#permission-grid-modes) |

### Permission layout modes

| Value | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | PERMISSION_LAYOUT_MODE_UNSPECIFIED | No explicit layout is selected |
| 1 | PERMISSION_LAYOUT_MODE_COMFY | Use the roomy permission layout |
| 2 | PERMISSION_LAYOUT_MODE_DENSE | Use the dense permission layout |

### Permission grid modes

| Value | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

| 1 | PERMISSION_GRID_MODE_SINGLE | Show one permission category at a time |
| 2 | PERMISSION_GRID_MODE_GRID | Show permission categories in a grid |

## Guild member layout settings object

The `guild_member_layout` field controls how the guild member view presents its members.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mode | int32 | [Guild member view mode](#guild-member-view-modes) |

### Guild member view modes

| Value | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | GUILD_MEMBER_VIEW_MODE_UNSPECIFIED | No explicit view mode is selected |
| 1 | GUILD_MEMBER_VIEW_MODE_TABLE | Display guild members in a table |
| 2 | GUILD_MEMBER_VIEW_MODE_GRID | Display guild members in a grid |

## Guild folder expanded state object

The `guild_folders` field stores which guild folders are expanded in the sidebar. The folders themselves are `guild_folders` on the [user settings object](/http-api/users/#user-settings-object).

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| expanded_folder_ids<sup>1</sup> | array[fixed64] | Expanded guild folder identifiers |

<sup>1</sup> Each value is the `id` of a [guild folder object](/http-api/users/#guild-folder-object). An identifier for a folder the layout no longer holds stays in the array and has no effect

## Hidden guild list buttons object

The `hidden_guild_buttons` field stores which guild list controls are hidden.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| download_button | bool | Whether the download button is hidden |
| help_button | bool | Whether the help button is hidden |

## Keyboard mode intro state object

The `keyboard_mode_intro` field stores whether the keyboard navigation introduction has been seen.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| seen | bool | Whether the keyboard navigation introduction was seen |

## Input monitoring prompts state object

The `input_monitoring` field stores whether the input monitoring prompt has been seen. No live surface reads or writes it.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| seen_cta | bool | Whether the input monitoring call to action was seen |

## Voice prompts state object

The `voice_prompts` field stores which voice confirmation prompts the account has suppressed.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| skip_hide_own_camera_confirm | bool | Whether hiding the caller's own camera skips confirmation |
| skip_hide_own_screenshare_confirm | bool | Whether hiding the caller's own screen share skips confirmation |

## Sudo prompt state object

The `sudo_prompt` field stores the verification method the account used most recently, so a client can preselect it the next time [sudo mode](/http-api/users/mfa/#sudo-mode) is required.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| last_used_mfa_method?<sup>1</sup> | int32 | [MFA method](#mfa-methods) most recently used for sudo verification |

<sup>1</sup> The assigned values correspond to `totp` and `webauthn` in `mfa_method` of the [sudo verification object](/http-api/users/mfa/#sudo-verification-object)

### MFA methods

| Value | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | MFA_METHOD_UNSPECIFIED | No method is recorded |
| 1 | MFA_METHOD_TOTP | Time-based one-time password |
| 3 | MFA_METHOD_WEBAUTHN | WebAuthn credential |

The value 2 is not assigned.

## Keybind settings object

The `keybinds` field stores custom keybinds and voice transmit behaviour.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| custom_keybinds | array[[custom keybind](#custom-keybind-object) object] | Custom keybinds |
| transmit_mode<sup>1</sup> | string | Voice transmit mode |
| push_to_talk_release_delay_ms?<sup>2</sup> | uint32 | Push-to-talk release delay in milliseconds |

<sup>1</sup> The first-party client recognises `voice_activity` and `voice_push_to_talk`, and falls back to `voice_activity` for the empty string and for any other value

<sup>2</sup> Read only while `transmit_mode` is `voice_push_to_talk`. The first-party client clamps it to the range 20 through 2000, treats 20 as the default, and omits the field entirely while it holds the default

## Custom keybind object

One entry binds one input combination to one action. The entry has its own `enabled` flag and its combination has another. The first-party client gates a custom keybind on the entry's flag alone, and reads `enabled` on a combination only for a built-in default binding.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id<sup>1</sup> | string | Keybind identifier |
| action?<sup>2</sup> | string | Action performed by the keybind |
| combo? | [keybind combo](#keybind-combo-object) object | Input combination |
| enabled | bool | Whether the keybind is enabled |

<sup>1</sup> Chosen by the client. The first-party client generates a replacement when it reads an entry whose `id` is the empty string

<sup>2</sup> An action name the client defines. The first-party client keeps an entry whose action it does not recognise and clears `action`

## Keybind combo object

One combination describes the key, modifiers, and buttons that trigger a keybind. The modifier flags are independent of each other, and `ctrl_or_meta` is a modifier of its own.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| key | string | Key value |
| code? | string | Physical key code |
| ctrl_or_meta<sup>1</sup> | bool | Whether Control or Meta is required according to the platform |
| ctrl | bool | Whether Control is required |
| alt | bool | Whether Alt is required |
| shift | bool | Whether Shift is required |
| meta | bool | Whether Meta is required |
| global? | bool | Whether the combination is registered globally |
| enabled?<sup>2</sup> | bool | Whether the combination is active |
| modifier_only | bool | Whether the combination contains only modifier keys |
| both_sides | bool | Whether either side of a paired modifier is accepted |
| mouse_button? | uint32 | Mouse button number |
| gamepad_button? | uint32 | Gamepad button number |

<sup>1</sup> Resolves to Meta on macOS and to Control on every other platform, so one stored combination expresses the platform-native accelerator

<sup>2</sup> An absent value here reads as active, the opposite of the default for `enabled` on the [custom keybind](#custom-keybind-object) that owns the combination

## Chat input settings object

The `chat_input` field controls message composer behaviour.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| convert_emoticons? | bool | Whether emoticons are converted to emoji |

## Reaction emoji object

The `double_tap_reaction` field stores the emoji that a double tap on a message adds as a reaction. It has the same shape as the [reaction emoji object](/gateway/events/#reaction-emoji-object). A Unicode emoji sets only `name`, and a custom emoji sets both `id` and `name`.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id?<sup>1</sup> | string | Custom emoji ID, absent for a Unicode emoji |
| name | string | Unicode emoji, or the custom emoji's name |

<sup>1</sup> The decimal form of a [snowflake](/snowflakes/). Fluxer never resolves it, so it can name a custom emoji the account can no longer use
