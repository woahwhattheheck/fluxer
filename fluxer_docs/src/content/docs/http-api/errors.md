title: Errors
description: The error envelope, the status fallback mapping, and both code registries.
---

A failed request returns a JSON [error response](/http-api/#error-response). It has a stable `code` a client matches on and a localised `message` for a person to read. Every HTTP API and Admin API failure uses this shape. An OAuth2 protocol failure is the one exception.

:::caution[Match on `code` alone]
The `message` field is rendered from a template, is translated per request, and can change wording without notice. An HTTP status is not enough on its own, because many distinct codes share one status.
:::

## Selecting the error code

An error response always has `code` and `message`. A failure with more to report adds its own members beside those two, at the top level of the response. A rate limit denial adds `global` and `retry_after`, a missing scope adds `required_scope`, and a validation failure adds `errors`.

:::note[OAuth2 endpoints use a different envelope]
An OAuth2 protocol failure raised by the [OAuth2 resource](/http-api/oauth2/) answers with the RFC 6749 shape. That body is `error` and `error_description` and nothing else, so its values appear in no registry here.
:::

## Supplementary members

The error code determines which supplementary members a failure has, and most codes have none. A client reads only the members documented for the code it matched. `errors` is the list of field violations. `retry_after` is the delay before another attempt is admitted. `global` is `true` on a global rate limit denial and `false` on a route one. `required_scope` is the OAuth2 scope the request is missing. `has_mfa` and `methods` are the [sudo mode](/http-api/users/mfa/#sudo-mode) proofs an account can supply.

`GLOBAL_IP_BANNED` and `GLOBAL_IP_TEMPORARILY_BANNED` have their own members:

- `ip_address` is the normalised client address.
- `appeal_email` is the address an appeal is sent to.
- `appeals_supported` is `true` only for the permanent ban.
- `ban_kind` is `permanent` or `temporary_24h`.
- `expires_at` is an ISO 8601 timestamp when the ban records an expiry, and `null` otherwise, including on every permanent ban.

## Validation failure codes

Fluxer answers a field-level failure with 400 and a top-level `errors` array. Each element identifies one failed input field. The [validation error object](/http-api/#validation-error-object) documents the element shape.

Invalid JSON bodies, form bodies, query strings and path parameters return `INVALID_FORM_BODY`. Each entry in `errors` identifies a field and its message. An entry can also include a stable `code` from the [validation error code registry](#validation-error-code-registry). Entries without a code have an English message.

[Modify current user settings](/http-api/users/settings/#modify-current-user-settings) is the one operation that answers such a failure with the top-level code `VALIDATION_ERROR` instead of `INVALID_FORM_BODY`. Its trusted domain, age restriction, and synced preferences decisions each report one element with a registry `code` and a fixed English `message`.

The `path` of an element is the dot-joined position of the failed value, so a nested field appears as `embeds.0.title`. A failure with no field position uses the literal path `root`. Fluxer produces at most one element for each distinct pair of `path` and `code`.

### Example

```json
{
  "code": "INVALID_FORM_BODY",
  "message": "Invalid form body.",
  "errors": [
    {
      "path": "embeds.0.title",
      "code": "CONTENT_EXCEEDS_MAX_LENGTH",
      "message": "Text must not exceed 256 characters."
    }
  ]
}
```

:::note[An empty body reports the missing fields]
An empty or whitespace-only body becomes `{}`, so the response reports the fields the schema then finds missing. A body that does not parse as JSON returns 400 `INVALID_FORM_BODY` with one element at path `body` and code `INVALID_FORMAT`.
:::

Fluxer normalises empty values on all targets before validation runs. An empty string becomes `null` wherever it appears, including inside an array element. A nested object becomes `null` when it holds no members. It also becomes `null` when every one of its members is `null` after Fluxer has applied the same rule to each of them. The top-level object itself is never replaced, so a request that sends nothing still reaches the schema as an object and fails on the fields the schema requires.

:::caution[An enumerated validation failure answers 400 alone]
A validation failure whose elements have enumerated codes answers 400 with its elements in `errors`. Its top-level code is `INVALID_FORM_BODY` everywhere except [Modify current user settings](/http-api/users/settings/#modify-current-user-settings). Any other status, retry guidance, or response header from the original failure is dropped.
:::

### Default schema failure codes

A constraint in a route's request schema can name its own [validation code](#validation-error-code-registry). When it names none, Fluxer maps the failure to one of the codes below by the kind of constraint that failed.

| Constraint | Code | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| String longer than its maximum | CONTENT_EXCEEDS_MAX_LENGTH<sup>1</sup> | A string value exceeded the maximum length the schema declares |
| Email format | INVALID_EMAIL_ADDRESS | A value declared as an email address did not parse as one |
| UUID format | INVALID_SNOWFLAKE | A value declared as a UUID did not parse as one |
| Any other constraint | INVALID_FORMAT<sup>2</sup> | Every constraint kind not listed above |

<sup>1</sup> A string shorter than its minimum reports `INVALID_FORMAT`, and so does a length bound on anything other than a string

<sup>2</sup> Covers a type, union, enumerated value, unknown key, minimum length, numeric or date bound, multiple, key, element, or custom constraint, a constraint kind the mapping does not recognise, and a constraint that names a code outside the registry

## HTTP status fallback codes

A failure that has an HTTP status and no recognised Fluxer error code takes the fallback `code` its status selects below. Where an operation or one of the registries below names the error, Fluxer keeps that more specific code. An unclassified 401, 413, 422, or 429 falls back to `GENERAL_ERROR`.

Fluxer answers an unrecognised failure with 500 `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` and a generic message that names no detail. A failure that has a registered API code but no status returns 400, except `GENERAL_ERROR`, which returns 500.

| Status | Code | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | BAD_REQUEST | The request was malformed or failed a precondition |
| 403 | FORBIDDEN | The caller lacks permission for the operation |
| 404 | NOT_FOUND<sup>1</sup> | The target resource does not exist or is not visible |
| 405 | METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED | The HTTP method is not accepted on the route |
| 409 | CONFLICT | The request conflicts with the current state of the resource |
| 410 | GONE | The resource is permanently unavailable |
| 500 | INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR<sup>2</sup> | An unexpected internal failure occurred |
| 501 | NOT_IMPLEMENTED | The requested capability is not implemented |
| 502 | BAD_GATEWAY | An upstream dependency returned an invalid response |
| 503 | SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE | The service is temporarily unable to handle the request |
| 504 | GATEWAY_TIMEOUT | An upstream dependency did not respond in time |
| default<sup>3</sup> | GENERAL_ERROR | Any status without a specific mapping |

<sup>1</sup> Also the code a request that matches no route receives, so an unrouted path and an unreadable resource are indistinguishable from the body alone

<sup>2</sup> Also the code an unrecognised failure receives, with the generic localised message

<sup>3</sup> A failure that lands on this row keeps its own status

## Client errors as an abuse signal

Repeated invalid requests or credentials can trigger a temporary IP ban. A `4xx` answer to a request with no authenticated user adds to that signal, weighted by status. A 429 weighs 3, a 401 weighs 0.75, a 403 weighs 0.5, and every other 4xx weighs 0.25. One request adds at most one signal, and a request from a private or exempt address adds none. Stop using a rejected credential. Change a rejected request before sending it again, and after a 429 wait `retry_after` before the next attempt.

:::caution[An automatic ban answers every request for 24 hours]
A temporary ban lasts 24 hours by default. Requests from the banned address return 403 `GLOBAL_IP_TEMPORARILY_BANNED`. Use `expires_at` from the response when available.
:::

## API error code registry

These codes appear in the top-level `code` field of an error response, sent as the exact JSON string shown. The registry is closed. Each entry states the leading sentence of the English source message, without its final full stop. Those messages call a [guild](/http-api/guilds/) a community.

:::note[The rendered `message` fills in the braced values]
A description containing a value in braces is an ICU MessageFormat template. `You've reached the maximum of {count, plural, one {# emoji} other {# emojis}}` renders as a complete sentence with the applicable limit.
:::

:::note[A rendered `message` can run longer than the registry entry]
Several source messages append a further recovery sentence with a template value such as a maximum size, a format list, or a retry delay.

## Localisation

Messages use the account's locale or the request's `Accept-Language` header, with an English fallback. Early rejections such as IP bans can use the header rather than the account locale. See [Locales](/topics/locales/).

The `code` field is never translated. Validation entries without a code have an English message.
