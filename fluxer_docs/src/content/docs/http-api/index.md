description: Request format, body representations, shared headers, cross-origin policy, and the error objects.
---

Use the HTTP API to read and change resources. Discover the base URL through [`/.well-known/fluxer`](/http-api/instance/#get-instance-discovery). Third-party clients use `endpoints.api_public`, and the first-party web application uses `endpoints.api_client`.

Use `/v1`, the only API version.

Read resource limits from [instance discovery](/http-api/instance/#limit-keys). Attachment counts, expression counts and profile field lengths can differ between deployments.

[Field notation](/#field-notation) explains optional, nullable, and nullish fields.

## Request format

Send JSON bodies with `Content-Type: application/json`. Responses are UTF-8 JSON unless an operation states otherwise. Message operations and webhook execution also accept multipart bodies, and OAuth2 token operations accept form bodies.

An overloaded instance returns 503 `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` with `Retry-After: 1`. Wait before retrying.

Unknown paths and unsupported methods return 404 `NOT_FOUND` without an `Allow` header. Trailing slashes are significant.

Every `GET` route supports `HEAD`, returning the same status and headers without a body. Routes without `GET` do not support `HEAD`. The [same-host origin requirement](#cross-origin-requests) also applies to `HEAD`.

## Request body formats

Each operation documents its accepted body format and fields.

Use `application/json` for JSON and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for OAuth2 form bodies. OAuth2 token operations also accept `multipart/form-data`.

[Create message](/http-api/messages/#create-message), [Modify message](/http-api/messages/#modify-message) and [Execute webhook](/http-api/webhooks/#execute-webhook) accept these multipart fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| payload_json?<sup>1</sup> | string | JSON object with the operation's complete message request payload |
| files[n]?<sup>2</sup> | file | Direct attachment file at zero-based index `n` |

<sup>1</sup> An absent `payload_json` is read as an empty object. A value that is not a string, or does not parse as JSON, is rejected with `INVALID_JSON_IN_PAYLOAD_JSON`

<sup>2</sup> `n` is a run of decimal digits, at most 10000 and below the deployment's [`max_attachments_per_message`](/http-api/instance/#limit-keys) limit, which defaults to 10

The legacy names `file` and `file` followed by an index are accepted as file fields as well, and a bare `file` takes the next free legacy index.

Field-name failures are rejected with their own code:

- An index outside either bound returns `FILE_INDEX_EXCEEDS_MAXIMUM`.
- Any other name beginning with `files[` returns `INVALID_FILE_FIELD_NAME`.
- Two file fields resolving to the same index return `DUPLICATE_FILE_INDEX`.
- More than one file supplied for one index returns `MULTIPLE_FILES_FOR_INDEX_NOT_ALLOWED`.
- Where the resolved limit is 0, any file field at all returns `ATTACHMENTS_NOT_ALLOWED_FOR_MESSAGE`.

Include the multipart boundary in `Content-Type` and each field name in `Content-Disposition`. Malformed multipart bodies return `FAILED_TO_PARSE_MULTIPART_FORM_DATA`. Unknown fields and non-file values for valid `files[n]` indices are ignored.

A multipart message body MAY also have `content`, `nonce`, `tts`, `flags`, `favorite_meme_id`, and `sticker_ids` as plain form fields. Each overrides the member of the same name in the parsed `payload_json`, and `sticker_ids` collects every value it is given.

The `attachments` array inside `payload_json` maps attachment metadata to files by matching each attachment `id` to `n` in `files[n]`. A metadata entry that has a `filename` but matches no supplied file is rejected with `NO_FILE_FOR_ATTACHMENT_METADATA`, and two metadata entries claiming the same file index are rejected with `DUPLICATE_ATTACHMENT_IDS_NOT_ALLOWED`. A supplied file that no metadata entry claims is still attached, taking its index as the attachment ID and its uploaded filename as the attachment filename. A metadata entry that has no `filename` and matches no supplied file is read as a pre-uploaded attachment reference.

[Messages](/http-api/messages/) defines the attachment metadata and pre-uploaded attachment form, and [Attachment uploads](/topics/uploads/) defines the separate relay upload flow.

:::caution[Multipart indices are attachment IDs]
Each direct file's `files[n]` index is also the `id` in its attachment metadata entry. Fluxer reads `n` from the field name, so part order sets no identity. The indices need not begin at zero and need not be consecutive.
:::

## Input normalisation

:::note[Empty values are normalised before validation]
An empty string becomes `null` at any depth, and an empty nested object becomes `null` below the root of the payload.
:::

This normalisation applies to JSON and form bodies, query strings, path parameters, request headers, and cookies.

A nested object containing only `null` values also becomes `null`. The root object never becomes `null`, even when it is empty or has only `null` values. An empty body is treated as `{}` and validated for required fields. Malformed JSON returns 400 `INVALID_FORM_BODY` with a validation error at path `body` and code `INVALID_FORMAT`.

:::caution[Message operations preserve empty values]
[Create message](/http-api/messages/#create-message), [Modify message](/http-api/messages/#modify-message), and [Execute webhook](/http-api/webhooks/#execute-webhook) do not apply this normalisation.
:::

Those operations document their own JSON validation errors.

## Authentication

[Authentication](/authentication/) defines the accepted `Authorization` schemes and links to the OAuth2 scope registry. Each operation states which credentials it accepts. The [sudo verification object](/http-api/users/mfa/#sudo-verification-object) defines the proof required for sensitive account operations.

An OAuth2 bearer access token is accepted only where a route opts in, and the resource page says so. Everywhere else a bearer credential is refused with 403 `ACCESS_DENIED`. An account with a suspicious activity flag is refused with 403 `ACCOUNT_SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY`.

## Standard request headers

These headers are accepted across resources. An operation-specific header is documented in that operation's request header table.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authorization? | string | The single credential for an authenticated request, in one of the [accepted schemes](/authentication/#authorization-schemes) |
| Content-Type?<sup>1</sup> | string | Request body media type and, for multipart bodies, the boundary |
| Accept-Language?<sup>2</sup> | string | Selects the locale used for an error `message` |
| X-Audit-Log-Reason?<sup>3</sup> | string | Free-text reason recorded on the resulting audit log entry |
| X-Fluxer-Client-Properties?<sup>4</sup> | string | Base64-encoded JSON with the native client's `os`, read when an authentication session is created |
| X-Fluxer-Sudo-Mode-JWT?<sup>5</sup> | string | A sudo mode proof previously issued to the authenticated user |
| X-Captcha-Token?<sup>6</sup> | string | The CAPTCHA solution issued by the selected provider |
| X-Captcha-Type?<sup>6</sup> | string | Either `hcaptcha` or `turnstile`, selecting the provider that issued the token |
| X-Request-ID?<sup>7</sup> | string | A correlation identifier the client chooses, echoed unchanged in the response |
| User-Agent? | string | The originating client description recorded on a new authentication session and on an Admin audit entry |
| Origin?<sup>8</sup> | string | The browser origin used for cross-origin negotiation and for the mutating same-host origin check |

<sup>1</sup> Use the media type specified in [request body formats](#request-body-formats)

<sup>2</sup> The configured locale of the authenticated account takes precedence, so this header selects the locale only for an unauthenticated request or an account with no configured locale

<sup>3</sup> The value is read verbatim with no percent-decoding, then stripped of form feed and right-to-left override characters and trimmed. A blank or too-long value is treated as absent

<sup>4</sup> Read only for a native Fluxer `User-Agent`, at most 4096 characters, and only the `os` member is used

<sup>5</sup> A valid token replaces the sudo proof fields in the operation body and is echoed in the response header without extending its lifetime.

<sup>6</sup> Read only while the instance has a provider configured and the operation is gated. The handshake is defined in [CAPTCHA handling](/topics/captcha/)

<sup>7</sup> A supplied value is echoed back unchanged and unvalidated

<sup>8</sup> The exact use is defined in [cross-origin requests](#cross-origin-requests)

A client MUST NOT send an `X-Request-ID` it is not willing to see in logs, because Fluxer echoes and records the value without validating it.

An `X-Audit-Log-Reason` normalised to more than 512 characters is discarded, and the request still succeeds. Every request is normalised this way, but only an operation that supports an audit reason records the result.

## Standard response headers

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| X-Fluxer-Version?<sup>1</sup> | string | The build version of the instance that served the request |
| X-Request-ID?<sup>2</sup> | string | The identifier assigned to the request |
| X-Fluxer-Sudo-Mode-JWT?<sup>3</sup> | string | The sudo mode token for the caller, present only on an operation that completes a sudo proof |
| Content-Type? | string | The media type of the representation, absent from a response with no body |
| Cache-Control?<sup>4</sup> | string | The literal value `no-cache` unless the operation sets its own directive |
| Access-Control-Allow-Origin?<sup>5</sup> | string | The request `Origin` when it is a configured application origin, and the literal `*` on routes that set their own wildcard |
| Access-Control-Expose-Headers?<sup>5</sup> | string | The literal value `X-Fluxer-Version, ETag` |
| Vary?<sup>5</sup> | string | The literal value `Origin`, sent whenever the allowed origin was echoed |
| Retry-After?<sup>6</sup> | string | Whole seconds to wait, sent on a rate limit denial, a slowmode denial, a resource lock, and the in-flight ceiling 503 |
| X-RateLimit-Limit?<sup>7</sup> | string | Present on a route denial and on a successful bot or webhook request |
| X-RateLimit-Remaining?<sup>7</sup> | string | Present on a route denial and on a successful bot or webhook request |
| X-RateLimit-Reset?<sup>7</sup> | string | Unix timestamp in seconds |
| X-RateLimit-Reset-After?<sup>7</sup> | string | Seconds until the bucket resets |
| X-RateLimit-Bucket?<sup>7</sup> | string | A stable 16-character hash of the bucket name |
| X-RateLimit-Scope?<sup>7</sup> | string | Present on a rate limit denial, taking the value `user`, `shared`, or `global` |
| X-RateLimit-Global?<sup>7</sup> | string | Present on a global rate limit denial, taking the literal value `true` |

<sup>1</sup> The value is the literal `dev` when the build has no version stamp

<sup>2</sup> A generated UUID unless the request supplied its own, in which case that value is echoed back unchanged and unvalidated

<sup>3</sup> A token newly issued where the caller proved sudo mode again, and otherwise the incoming proof echoed back with no extension of its lifetime

<sup>4</sup> Absent from a response with no body

<sup>5</sup> `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` is sent on every response the instance CORS policy handles. `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and `Vary` are sent only for an allowed origin

<sup>6</sup> The literal 1 on the in-flight ceiling 503, and otherwise the [rate limit header](/topics/rate-limits/#rate-limit-headers) contract

<sup>7</sup> The complete contract is defined in [Rate limits](/topics/rate-limits/#rate-limit-headers)

An operation that sets its own `Cache-Control` keeps that value. A response whose `Content-Type` names a stylesheet, script, font, image, video, or audio representation receives `public, max-age=31536000`.

<a id="rate-limits"></a>

## Rate limits

Every route consumes its own rate limit bucket. A route that is not exempt from the global bucket also counts against one global bucket. A denial returns 429 `RATE_LIMITED`. [Rate limits](/topics/rate-limits/) defines the bucket scoping rules, the global allowance, the 429 body, the scope registry, and the complete `X-RateLimit-*` header contract.

:::note[These 429 responses have no `X-RateLimit-*` header]
A 429 `RESOURCE_LOCKED` response has `Retry-After: 1`, and a 429 `IP_AUTHORIZATION_RESEND_COOLDOWN` response has the remaining cooldown in whole seconds. A client that reads the bucket headers branches on `code`.
:::

A global denial has `Retry-After`, `X-RateLimit-Scope`, and `X-RateLimit-Global` alone.

## Hosted-only routes

A small set of routes exists only on the hosted Fluxer deployment. A self-hosted deployment answers one of them with 404 `NOT_FOUND`. [Deployment availability](/http-api/deployment-availability/) lists every hosted-only route and states how a client resolves the deployment kind before authenticating.

## Cross-origin requests

The CORS response policy is an allow-list of exactly two origins, the deployment's configured web application endpoint and its marketing endpoint. A request whose `Origin` matches one of them receives `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` set to that origin and `Vary: Origin`. Every other request, including one that sends no `Origin`, receives no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` from that policy. Credentialed cross-origin requests are not enabled, so `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is never sent.

The paths below are readable from any origin. `/v1/webhooks/{webhook_id}/{token}` and `/v1/webhooks/{webhook_id}/{token}/messages/{message_id}` have a second cross-origin policy that allows any origin. Four of the methods registered on them refuse the first-party web client outright, and that refusal is defined by [Origin refusal](/http-api/webhooks/#origin-refusal).

[Get instance discovery](/http-api/instance/#get-instance-discovery) on `/.well-known/fluxer`, [Get OpenAPI document](/http-api/instance/#get-openapi-document) on `/v1/openapi.json`, and [Get client geolocation](/http-api/instance/#get-client-geolocation) on `/v1/ip` set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` in the operation itself. A request whose `Origin` is absent or outside the allow-list receives `*`. For an allowed origin, the policy replaces `*` with that exact origin and sends `Vary: Origin`.

`Access-Control-Expose-Headers` is the value `X-Fluxer-Version, ETag`. Every other Fluxer response header, the rate limit headers and `X-Request-ID` included, is hidden from cross-origin script. `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` is `Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With, Accept-Language, X-Request-ID, If-None-Match`, so a cross-origin client revalidates an [ETag](/http-api/experiments/#get-experiment-assignments) it was served.

:::caution[Same-host mutations require a matching origin]
A production deployment rejects a non-`GET` request whose `Host` is `web.fluxer.app` or `web.canary.fluxer.app` unless its `Origin` is exactly `https://` followed by that same host, returning 403 `INVALID_API_ORIGIN`. A request sent to the API host is unaffected.

## Error response object

A JSON error response identifies the stable error code and a human-readable message. An operation can add further top-level members with structured detail. [Errors](/http-api/errors/) documents the code registries, the HTTP status fallback mapping, and the localisation behaviour.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| code<sup>1</sup> | string | Stable machine-readable [API error code](/http-api/errors/#api-error-code-registry) |
| message<sup>2</sup> | string | Human-readable description of this failure |
| errors?<sup>3</sup> | array[[validation error](#validation-error-object) object] | Request fields that failed validation |

<sup>1</sup> Every code is an uppercase symbolic name matching `[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*`

<sup>2</sup> The wording varies by locale and defaults to the code itself when the failure supplies no message

<sup>3</sup> Present on an `INVALID_FORM_BODY` response, and on any other failure that has field detail

### Example

```json
{
  "code": "MISSING_PERMISSIONS",
  "message": "Missing permissions"
}
```

The body has no request identifier. A client correlates a failure through the `X-Request-ID` response header.

:::note[Structured detail sits at the top level]
`IP_AUTHORIZATION_REQUIRED` has `ip_authorization_required`, `ticket`, `email`, and `resend_available_in`. `SUDO_MODE_REQUIRED` has `has_mfa` and `methods`.
:::

`MISSING_OAUTH_SCOPE` has `required_scope`, and `RATE_LIMITED` has `retry_after` and `global`, where `global` is `true` only on a global bucket denial. Each operation that produces one of those members documents it. A client MUST treat any member it does not recognise as absent. Two operations returning the same `code` can have different extra members, so a client MUST read the members its own operation documents.

## Validation error object

Each entry identifies one failed input field. A 400 response whose top-level code is `INVALID_FORM_BODY` has the array in `errors`. [Errors](/http-api/errors/#validation-failure-codes) states which failures produce it.

### Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| path<sup>1</sup> | string | The location of the request field that failed validation |
| code?<sup>2</sup> | string | Stable machine-readable validation code |
| message<sup>3</sup> | string | The human-readable description of this validation failure |

<sup>1</sup> A nested field is a dot-joined path such as `embeds.0.title`, and a failure with no field position uses the literal path `root`

<sup>2</sup> Present whenever the failure has an enumerated code from the [validation error code registry](/http-api/errors/#validation-error-code-registry)

<sup>3</sup> The localised message registered for the `code`, falling back to the code itself, and a fixed English string on a failure that has no code

### Example

```json
{
  "code": "INVALID_FORM_BODY",
  "message": "Invalid form body",
  "errors": [
    {"path": "name", "code": "BASE_TYPE_REQUIRED", "message": "This field is required"}
  ]
}
```

Fluxer produces at most one entry for each distinct pair of `path` and `code`, so a field that fails several constraints with the same `code` appears once.
