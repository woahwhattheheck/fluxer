title: Deployment availability
description: The hosted-only routes and the instance flags that report deployment kind.
---

The routes listed under [Hosted-only routes](#hosted-only-routes) exist only on the deployment Fluxer hosts. A self-hosted deployment runs the same release, and most of the HTTP API is identical on both.

A self-hosted deployment does not register those routes. A request to one returns 404 `NOT_FOUND` with no feature-specific code, so a caller cannot tell an unavailable route from an unrecognised path.

Credentials, permissions, premium state and OAuth2 scopes do not change route availability. Read the deployment kind from instance discovery.

## Deployment kind

Every deployment reports its kind in `self_hosted` on the [instance features object](/http-api/instance/#instance-features-object). The unauthenticated [instance discovery document](/http-api/instance/#get-instance-discovery) publishes it before a client holds any credential. `self_hosted` alone decides whether the API registers the routes below.

`stripe_enabled` on the same object reports only the `integrations.stripe.enabled` configuration value. A hosted deployment that reports it false still serves every route in the table below. A deployment reporting `stripe_enabled` true with no provider secret key configured behaves exactly like one reporting it false.

:::caution[Read `self_hosted` for the deployment kind]
Neither flag promises that a provider-dependent operation succeeds.
:::

When `stripe_enabled` is false or no provider secret key is configured, the answer depends on the operation. An operation that has to reach the provider fails with 400 `STRIPE_PAYMENT_NOT_AVAILABLE`, and [Receive Stripe webhook](/http-api/billing/#receive-stripe-webhook) fails with 400 `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_NOT_AVAILABLE`. These read operations report the absence in a 200 body instead:

- [Get refund eligibility](/http-api/billing/#get-refund-eligibility) reports `eligible` false with the reason `feature_unavailable`.
- [Get current subscription price](/http-api/premium/#get-current-subscription-price) reports null.
- [Get price IDs](/http-api/premium/#get-price-ids) reports the configured price IDs with every amount null.

<sup>1</sup> These are the only `/users/@me` routes a self-hosted deployment does not serve

<sup>2</sup> The webhook takes no credential and is authenticated by the provider signature header alone

<sup>3</sup> The same object appears as `billing.refund_eligibility` on [Get premium state](/http-api/premium/#get-premium-state), which every deployment serves, and there a self-hosted deployment reports `eligible` false with the reason `feature_unavailable`

<sup>4</sup> The same object appears as `billing.current_subscription_price` on [Get premium state](/http-api/premium/#get-premium-state), which every deployment serves

## Registered routes that resolve differently

A route every deployment registers can still produce a different answer on a self-hosted instance. Each operation page documents that difference.

Premium state is the clearest case. Every deployment registers [Get premium state](/http-api/premium/#get-premium-state) and [Set premium perks disabled](/http-api/premium/#set-premium-perks-disabled). A self-hosted instance still reports premium state and still records the perks-disabled flag. The response repeats the deployment kind in `self_hosted` on the [effective premium state object](/http-api/premium/#effective-premium-state-object). That flag alone does not make `is_premium` true. A self-hosted deployment grants premium to every account only while its instance [premium mode](/admin-api/instance/#premium-modes) is `everyone`. That mode also overrides the perks-disabled flag, so `is_premium` stays true while `premium_perks_disabled` is true.

The other instance feature flags published by [instance discovery](/http-api/instance/#instance-features-object) work the same way. `voice_enabled`, `presigned_attachment_uploads`, and `emails_enabled` each report whether a capability is switched on. The routes for that capability stay registered when the flag is false, so a client reads the flag before it uses them.
